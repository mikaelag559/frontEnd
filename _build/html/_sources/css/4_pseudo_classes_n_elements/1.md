# 1. Working with Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements in CSS

## 1.1. What are pseudo-classes, and how do they work?

Pseudo-classes are special CSS keywords that allow you to select an element based on its specific state or position. The element's state or position could include:

*   When it's active.
*   When it's being hovered over by a mouse.
*   When it's the first child of a parent.
*   When it's the last child of a parent.
*   When a link has been visited.
*   When it's disabled.

To use a pseudo-class, you add it to the selector by using a colon (`:`) followed by the name of the pseudo-class:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  /* CSS properties */
}
```

Let's see how you can use a pseudo-class to represent each of the states and positions we already mentioned.

1. The `:active` pseudo-class lets you select the active state of an element, like clicking on a button:

    ```css
    button:active {
        background: greenyellow;
    }
    ```

2. The `:hover` pseudo-class defines the hover state of an element. An example would be hovering over a button or link:

    ```css
    a:hover {
        text-decoration: none;
        background: crimson;
    }
    ```

3. The `:first-child` pseudo-class selects an element that is the first child of its parent element. Here's an HTML example showing a `div` element containing multiple paragraph elements:

    ```html
    <div class="container">
        <p> first child  </p>
        <p> second child </p>
        <p> third child  </p>
        <p> last child   </p>
    </div>
    ```

    Here's the CSS that selects the first paragraph element in that `div` container:

    ```css
    .container p:first-child {
        background: lightcoral;
        padding: 0.4rem;
    }
    ```

    The first paragraph element in that `div` will receive the `lightcoral` background color and `padding` of `0.4rem` on all four sides.

4. The `:last-child` pseudo-class targets the last element that is the child of its parent. Here is an example of targeting the last paragraph element in the container `div` element:

    ```css
    .container p:last-child {
        background: lightcoral;
        padding: 0.4rem;
    }
    ```

5. The `:visited` pseudo-class lets you style a link the user has already visited:

    ```css
    a:visited {
        color: purple;
    }
    ```

6. The `:disabled` pseudo-class lets you style an interactive element in disabled mode:

    ```css
    button:disabled {
        background-color: lightgray;  
    }
    ```

As you can see, pseudo-classes let you style elements based on user interactions, like hovering or visiting a link. This makes your website feel more interactive.

Apart from the pseudo-classes already mentioned, there are others like:

*   `:focus`
*   `:first-of-type`
*   `:last-of-type`
*   `:nth-of-type`
*   `:modal`
*   `:enabled`
*   `:checked`
*   `:required`, and more.

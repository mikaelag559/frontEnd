## 1.16. What is the `aria-live` attribute and how does it work?

The `aria-live` attribute creates a live region on your page which can be used to notify screen reader users of dynamic content changes in the live region as they occur.

Common uses of live regions include messages that are displayed after an action has been taken (such as an error message or confirmation), content that updates periodically (such as a ticker, marquee, or countdown timer), or general status messages (such as updates about a process).

Because the reading focus for screen readers can only be at one place at a time, screen reader users will not notice a content change if their focus is on another part of the page. Live regions allow screen reader users to be automatically notified of changes that happen on the page in real time. Without a live region, screen reader users might miss important content updates available to sighted users, since a sighted user has the ability to scan the entire page.

There are three possible values for this attribute, based on the priority of the information.

If you set `aria-live` to the value `assertive` that means that the update is very important. It has the highest priority, so the user should be notified immediately.

This means that the screen reader will interrupt any announcement it is currently making to announce the content change in the live region. Such interruptions can be extremely disruptive, so the `assertive` value should only be used for time-sensitive or critical notifications.

```html
<div aria-live="assertive">
    <p>Your session will expire in 30 seconds.</p>
</div>
```
    

The next value in order of priority is `polite`.

This value means that the update is not urgent, so the screen reader can wait until any current announcement is finished or until the user stops typing before announcing the update. Most live regions will use the `polite` value.

```html
<div aria-live="polite">
    <p>File successfully uploaded</p>
</div>
```

The lowest priority value for `aria-live` is `off` which means that the update will not be announced unless the content is in an element that currently has keyboard focus. Realistically, this value is almost never used as the use case is very narrow and it is not implemented consistently (if at all) across screen readers. If you need live regions, plan on using `polite` for everything except critical messages that need `assertive`.

It's also important to note that the `aria-live` attribute is not required if the updated information is contained in an element with an ARIA role of `alert`, `log`, `marquee`, `status`, or `timer`, as these roles already have default `aria-live` values. But the default value can be changed by explicitly setting `aria-live` on the element.

Choosing the right `aria-live` value depends on the priority of the updated information.

If the updates are urgent, you should notify the user immediately with `assertive`. But you should use this only if the updates are really urgent because sudden interruptions can potentially disorient users and affect the user experience.

If the update can wait until the current task is finished, you should use `polite` instead.

The `aria-live` attribute lets assistive technologies know when the content is changing dynamically on a web page. This helps users with disabilities stay updated on important announcements and updates.

By using `aria-live` appropriately, you can ensure that users are aware of these updates based on their priority.

## 1.17. What are some common ARIA states used on custom control elements?

Semantic form control elements like `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `button`, and `fieldset` have built-in states that are conveyed to assistive technologies.

For example, you could use the `disabled` attribute to disable a button or the `checked` attribute to indicate that a checkbox is checked.

But if you are creating a custom control element, you need to use ARIA attributes to convey the state of the control to assistive technologies.

In this lecture video, we will discuss a few common ARIA states that you can use on custom control elements.

The first ARIA state we will discuss is `aria-selected`. This state is used to indicate that an element is selected. You can use this state on custom controls like a tabbed interface, a listbox, or a grid.

Here is an example of how you can use `aria-selected` on a custom tab control:

```html
<div role="tablist">
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="true">Tab 1</button>
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Tab 2</button>
    <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Tab 3</button>
</div>
```
    

Tabs are used to display multiple panels of content in a limited space. The `aria-selected` state is used to indicate which tab is currently selected.

When the user selects a tab, the `aria-selected` state of the selected tab is set to `true`, and the `aria-selected` state of the other tabs is set to `false`.

Another common ARIA state is `aria-disabled`. This state is used to indicate that an element is disabled only to people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers. It is important to note that `aria-disabled` does not actually disable the element. It is up to you, the developer, to make it look and act like a disabled element. This attribute is also commonly used on native HTML elements in place of the `disabled` attribute. Which one you choose will depend on the context the button is being used.

Here is an example of how you can use `aria-disabled` on a custom edit button:

```html
<div role="button" tabindex="-1" aria-disabled="true">Edit</div>
```
    

The `aria-disabled` attribute is used to tell screen reader users that the edit button is disabled and cannot be interacted with. Again, it does not actually disable the button. When using `aria-disabled`,you will need to apply styling and JavaScript to make the control look and behave like a disabled button.

In most cases, you will probably use the native button element, but there are cases where you might need to use a custom control. So, it is essential to know how to convey the state of the control to assistive technologies.

The next ARIA state we will discuss is `aria-haspopup`. This state is used to indicate that an interactive element will trigger a popup element when activated. You can only use the `aria-haspopup` attribute when the popup has one of the following roles: `menu`, `listbox`, `tree`, `grid`, or `dialog`. The value of `aria-haspopup` must be either one of these roles or `true`, which defaults to the `menu` role.

Here is an example of a file editor menu that uses `aria-haspopup`:

```html
<button id="menubutton" aria-haspopup="menu" aria-controls="filemenu" aria-expanded="false">File</button>
<ul id="filemenu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="menubutton" hidden>
    <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Open</li>
    <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">New</li>
    <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Save</li>
    <li role="menuitem" tabindex="-1">Delete</li>
</ul>
```

The `aria-haspopup` state is used to indicate that the `File` menu button will open a popup menu when activated. Screen reader users may hear this additional information when they navigate to the button.

You will need to use JavaScript to show and hide the popup menu, and to implement proper keyboard support for interacting with the menu. Also, please note that the ARIA `menu` role refers to a very specific type of menu. It generally refers to a list of actions that the user can invoke, similar to a menu on a desktop application. It does not include more common uses of what we typically refer to as "menus", such as navigation menus. Realistically, most "menus" you create on the web will not be ARIA menus and you will not use `aria-haspopup` with them.

The next ARIA state we will discuss is `aria-required`. The `aria-required` attribute is used to indicate that a field needs to be filled out before the form is submitted. Here is an example of working with the `aria-required` attribute for a custom form control.

```html
<div id="name-label">Full Name*</div>
<div role="textbox" contenteditable aria-labelledby="name-label" aria-required="true" id="name"></div>
```
    

We need to use the `contenteditable` attribute so users can type in their input. We are also using the `aria-required` attribute set to `true` to indicate that this custom form control is required.

To make the form control look like a normal form control, you would need to add CSS. You would also need to add JavaScript to prevent the form from being submitted without content.

If the label already has the word `required`, then you should omit the `aria-required` attribute. This ensures that screen readers only announce the word required once.

In most cases, you will probably use the native `label` and `form` elements with the `required` attribute. But if you need to create a custom form control, then it is important to add the `aria-required` attribute when necessary.

Additionally, the `aria-required` attribute can also be used on native form inputs, such as the `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements. This is often preferred to the native required attribute, since the required attribute may have potential usability and accessibility concerns, particularly with the default error handling provided by the browser. Ultimately, you will need to test in order to determine which attribute is best for your situation.

The last ARIA state we will discuss is `aria-checked`. This attribute is used to indicate whether an element is in the checked state. It is most commonly used when creating custom checkboxes, radio buttons, switches, and listboxes.

Here is an example of how you can use `aria-checked` on a custom checkbox control:

```html
<div role="checkbox" aria-checked="true" tabindex="0">Checkbox</div>
```
    

Native checkbox elements have a built-in `checked` state that is conveyed to assistive technologies. But if you are creating a custom checkbox control, you will need to use the `aria-checked` attribute to indicate its state.

When the user interacts with the custom checkbox control, you will need to use the `aria-checked` state to reflect the new state of the checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, the `aria-checked` attribute is set to `true`. When it is unchecked, it is set to `false`.

Native elements typically have better support and built-in accessibility features.

However, if you must create custom controls, using ARIA attributes is essential to convey the state of these controls to assistive technologies effectively.

As always, test your work to ensure that ARIA attributes are applied correctly and that the custom control functions in a way that is both accessible and user-friendly.


## 1.18. What is the `aria-controls` attribute, and how does it work?

The `aria-controls` attribute is used to create a programmatic relationship between an element that controls the presence of another element on the page, and the element it controls. This relationship can help screen reader users better understand how the control works. Common uses include a set of tabs that control the visibility of different sections of content, or a button that toggles the visibility of a menu.

Let's take a look at an example to see how this works. In this example of a tabbed interface, we have a `div` element with a set of three buttons:

```html
<div role="tablist">
    <button role="tab" id="tab1" aria-controls="section1" aria-selected="true">
    Tab 1
    </button>
    <button role="tab" id="tab2" aria-controls="section2" aria-selected="false">
    Tab 2
    </button>
    <button role="tab" id="tab3" aria-controls="section3" aria-selected="false">
    Tab 3
    </button>
</div>
```
    

Each button represents a tab and has a `role` attribute set to `tab`. In most tabbed interfaces, the first tab panel is visible by default, so the first tab button has an `aria-selected` attribute set to `true` to indicate that its associated section of content is currently visible The `aria-controls` attribute is used to associate each button with the section of content that it controls.

Here are the three sections of content that correspond to the tabs:

```html
<div id="section1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab1">
    Section 1 content
</div>

<div id="section2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab2" hidden>
    Section 2 content
</div>

<div id="section3" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab3" hidden>
    Section 3 content
</div>
```
    

Each section of content has a `role` attribute set to `tabpanel` and an `aria-labelledby` attribute that points to the corresponding tab to give the panel an accessible name. The `hidden` attribute is used to hide the sections of content that are not currently selected. Each section id matches the value of the `aria-controls` attribute on the corresponding button. The `section1` id matches the `aria-controls` attribute on the first button, `section2` matches the `aria-controls` attribute on the second button, and `section3` matches the `aria-controls` attribute on the third button. This is how the association between the tabs and their sections of content is established.

To switch between the different sections you will need to use JavaScript to update the `hidden` attribute on the section and the `aria-selected` attribute on the button based on which section is currently visible. Only one section can be visible at a time and it should not have the `hidden` attribute and `aria-selected` should be set to `true` on its button. The remaining hidden sections should all have the `hidden` attribute and `aria-selected` should be set to `false` on their buttons.

Tabs are a common use case for the `aria-controls` attribute, but it can be used in other scenarios where one element controls the visibility or behavior of another element. Other examples include accordions, dropdown menus, and modals.

The next time you design a user interface that involves controlling the visibility of elements, consider using the `aria-controls` attribute to establish the relationship between the controlling element and the controlled element.


## 1.19. What is the `aria-describedby` attribute, and how does it work?

The `aria-describedby` attribute is used to provide additional information about an element to screen reader users by referencing existing content on the page. It creates a programmatic association between the element and the content (technically referred to as an accessible description), which screen readers can use to inform users of the additional information when they interact with the element.

The most common use for `aria-describedby` is to associate instructions and error messages with form inputs. Due to the various methods screen reader users have for navigating a page, they may miss these messages when navigating between inputs. Using `aria-describedby` helps ensure that they will hear them.

Let's take a look at a few examples to understand how it works. In this first example, we have a `form` element that accepts a password:

```html
<form>
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" aria-describedby="password-help" />
    <p id="password-help">Your password must be at least 8 characters long.</p>
</form>
```
    

We are using a `label` element for the `Password` text and associating that with the password `input` field.

We also have a paragraph element that describes the password requirements. We are using the `aria-describedby` attribute to associate the password `input` field with the password requirements in the paragraph element. When a screen reader user interacts with this `input`, their screen reader will announce the name of the `input` (`Password`) and may then also announce the password requirements. This is not an absolute guarantee however as some screen readers may not automatically announce the additional content, or may only announce it in specific circumstances. This is not uncommon. Each screen reader is different and handles ARIA attributes in their own way. This does not negate the use of `aria-describedby`, as it will benefit screen reader users in general.

Another good use case for the `aria-describedby` attribute is when you have a delete `button`. Here is an example of a delete `button` followed by a message describing what will happen when the button is clicked:

```html
<button aria-describedby="delete-message">Delete</button>

<p id="delete-message">Warning! All deletions are permanent.</p>
```
    

Just like in the earlier example, we associate the delete button with the message using the `aria-describedby` attribute. The `id` value and the value of the `aria-describedby` attribute must match.

The `aria-describedby` attribute is a powerful attribute that can be used to help ensure that additional information about an element is provided to screen reader users when they interact with the element. It is most commonly used to associate instructions and error messages with form inputs in order to reduce the chance that screen reader users will miss these messages as they navigate the form.


## 1.20. When is the `alt` attribute needed, and what are some examples of good `alt` text?

Alternative text, often abbreviated as `alt` text, is a brief text description of an image. It provides essential information about the image for users who cannot see it, such as people who use screen readers and other assistive technologies.

It's essential for making websites accessible to people with visual disabilities.

Alternative text is also used by search engines to understand images. Some browsers may also display it when an image is not loaded properly. This can happen when the image file is missing or when the user has connectivity issues. So it's helpful for many different purposes.

A person with a visual disability will not be able to know what's in the image unless it's described in the alt text. An example of bad alt text for an image of a puppy would be "A cute puppy." This text is not specific enough to convey the important details of the image, like what does the puppy look like? Where is the puppy? Are there any important objects around the puppy?

Let's improve this. An example of good alternative text would be: "A black and white puppy with an orange collar lies on its belly in the sand, looking off to the side. A bright orange ball rests near its front paws."

Here you can see this in HTML with an image element, the `alt` attribute, and a more detailed description:

```html
<img src="puppy.png" alt="A black and white puppy with an orange collar lies on its belly in the sand, looking off to the side. A bright orange ball rests near its front paws." />
```
    

It is important to note that there is no one correct way to write alt text for an image. What you include in your description will depend on the context the picture is used in. For example, if the puppy picture was on a website about dog breeds, you might want to include more specifics about the physical description of the puppy and possibly ignore the fact that the puppy is at the beach playing with an orange ball. Ultimately, the `alt` text you use for an image should reflect the primary purpose for including the image on the page, and the information you provide should give people who can't see the image the necessary details to understand that purpose.

Here we have another example of a beautiful tropical resort. Let's describe it.

An example of bad `alt` text for this image would be "Resort."

This is too short and it doesn't provide enough information about the image. To improve this description, you could expand it to include the most important elements of the image:

"Tropical resort featuring a swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and bungalows."

You can use the alt attribute in HTML like this:

```html
<img src="resort.png" alt="Tropical resort featuring a swimming pool surrounded by palm trees and bungalows." />
```
    

Now that you know what makes good and bad `alt` text, let's see some of the best practices.

*   You should try to keep `alt` text short. It should be detailed enough to understand the image but not so long that it becomes confusing.
*   You should not try to describe every little detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the image.
*   Generally, you don't need to start with "image of" or "picture of." You can just start the description directly.
*   Also, if there's similar text around the image, you don't need to write it again.
*   It's usually recommended to end the alt text with a period for consistency.
*   If the image is a link to another page, instead of describing the image itself, the `alt` text should describe what will happen if users click on it.

For example, if your website has a right arrow icon that takes the user to the next page, instead of writing an alt text that only says "right arrow", like in this example, where you can see the alt attribute with this description:
```html
<a href="about.html">
    <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Right arrow." />
</a>
```
    

You should write something like this instead, where the `alt` text describes what will happen if users clicks on the image. They will go to the next page.

```html
<a href="about.html">
    <img src="arrow-right.png" alt="Go to next page." />
</a>
```
    

Only images that convey important information should have `alt` text. If an image is only used for decorative purposes, it should have `null` (empty) `alt` text, so it can be ignored by screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Here is an example of an empty `alt` attribute is empty:

```html
<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />
```
    

Every image on your website should have an `alt` attribute, even if it's empty. If you omit the `alt` attribute completely, some screen readers will read the file name instead, which can be distracting for people who use assistive technologies, so this is not recommended.

Finally, before your website is live, you should carefully test if screen readers can read the `alt` text correctly.

Writing effective `alt` text is essential for creating accessible web content. As a web developer, by providing clear descriptions of your images, you can make sure that everyone can engage with your website in an inclusive online experience.

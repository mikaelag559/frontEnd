# 2. Working with Numbers and Common Number Methods

## 2.1. What is `NaN` and how does `isNaN` work?

In JavaScript, `NaN` stands for "Not a Number". It's a special value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined numerical result. `NaN` is a property of the global object, and it's also considered a type of number in JavaScript, which might seem counterintuitive at first.

`NaN` is typically the result of operations that should return a number but can't produce a meaningful numerical value. For example:


```js
let result = 0 / 0;
console.log(result); // Output: NaN
```

In this case, dividing zero by zero is mathematically undefined, so JavaScript returns `NaN`. One peculiar property of `NaN` is that it's not equal to anything, including itself:


```js
console.log(NaN === NaN); // Output: false
```

This unique behavior makes it challenging to check if a value is `NaN` using standard comparison operators. To address this, JavaScript provides the `isNaN()` function. The `isNaN()` function property is used to determine whether a value is `NaN` or not. However, it's important to understand how `isNaN()` works, as it can sometimes produce unexpected results. Here's how `isNaN()` behaves:


```js
console.log(isNaN(NaN));       // true
console.log(isNaN(undefined)); // true
console.log(isNaN({}));        // true

console.log(isNaN(true));      // false
console.log(isNaN(null));      // false
console.log(isNaN(37));        // false

console.log(isNaN("37"));      // false: "37" is converted to 37
console.log(isNaN("37.37"));   // false: "37.37" is converted to 37.37
console.log(isNaN(""));        // false: empty string is converted to 0
console.log(isNaN(" "));       // false: string with a space is converted to 0

console.log(isNaN("blabla"));  // true: "blabla" is not a number
```

As you can see, `isNaN()` first attempts to convert the parameter to a number. If it can't be converted, it returns `true`. This behavior can lead to some surprising results, especially when dealing with strings that can be coerced into numbers.

Due to these potential inconsistencies, ES6 introduced `Number.isNaN()`. This method does not attempt to convert the parameter to a number before testing. It only returns `true` if the value is exactly `NaN`:


```js
console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN));        // true
console.log(Number.isNaN(Number.NaN)); // true
console.log(Number.isNaN(0 / 0));      // true

console.log(Number.isNaN("NaN"));      // false
console.log(Number.isNaN(undefined));  // false
console.log(Number.isNaN({}));         // false
console.log(Number.isNaN("blabla"));   // false
```

`Number.isNaN()` provides a more reliable way to check for `NaN` values, especially in cases where type coercion might lead to unexpected results with the global `isNaN()` function. In practice, when dealing with numerical operations or user inputs that should be numbers, it's often necessary to check for `NaN` to handle errors or unexpected inputs gracefully. For example:


```js
function divide(a, b) {
  let result = a / b;
  if (Number.isNaN(result)) {
    return "Error: Division resulted in NaN";
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(divide(10, 2));  // 5
console.log(divide(10, 0));  // Infinity
console.log(divide(0, 0));   // "Error: Division resulted in NaN"
```

In this example, we're using `Number.isNaN()` to catch cases where the division operation results in `NaN`, allowing us to handle this scenario appropriately. Understanding `NaN` and how to properly check for it is crucial for writing robust JavaScript code, especially when dealing with mathematical operations or parsing user inputs.

## 2.2. How do the `parseFloat()` and `parseInt()` methods work?

`parseFloat()` and `parseInt()` are two essential methods in JavaScript for converting strings to numbers. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with user input or processing data that comes in string format but needs to be treated as numerical values.

1. Let's start with `parseFloat()`. This method parses a string argument and returns a floating-point number. It's designed to extract a number from the beginning of a string, even if the string contains non-numeric characters later on. Remember that floats are numbers with decimal points. Here's how `parseFloat()` works:


    ```js
    console.log(parseFloat("3.14"));     // Output: 3.14
    console.log(parseFloat("3.14 abc")); // Output: 3.14
    console.log(parseFloat("3.14.5"));   // Output: 3.14
    console.log(parseFloat("abc 3.14")); // Output: NaN
    ```

    As you can see, `parseFloat()` starts parsing from the beginning of the string and continues until it encounters a character that can't be part of a floating-point number. If it can't find a valid number at the start of the string, it returns `NaN` (Not a Number).

2. `parseInt()`, on the other hand, parses a string argument and returns an integer. Like `parseFloat()`, it starts from the beginning of the string, but it stops at the first non-digit character. Here's how `parseInt()` works:


    ```js
    console.log(parseInt("42"));       // Output: 42
    console.log(parseInt("42px"));     // Output: 42
    console.log(parseInt("3.14"));     // Output: 3
    console.log(parseInt("abc123"));   // Output: NaN
    ```

    `parseInt()` stops parsing at the first non-digit it encounters. For floating-point numbers, it returns only the integer part. If it can't find a valid integer at the start of the string, it returns `NaN`.

Both methods have some noteworthy behaviors. They ignore leading whitespace:


```js
console.log(parseFloat("  3.14"));  // Output: 3.14
console.log(parseInt("  42"));      // Output: 42
```

They handle plus and minus signs at the beginning of the string:


```js
console.log(parseFloat("+3.14"));  // Output: 3.14
console.log(parseInt("-42"));      // Output: -42
```

It's worth noting that while these methods are powerful, they have some limitations. For instance, they don't handle all number formats, such as scientific notation, directly. For more complex parsing needs, you might need to use additional techniques or libraries.

In conclusion, `parseFloat()` and `parseInt()` are valuable tools for converting strings to numbers in JavaScript. Understanding how they work and their specific behaviors allows you to handle numeric data more effectively in your applications, especially when dealing with user inputs or external data sources.

## 2.3. What is the `.toFixed()` method and how does it work?

The `.toFixed()` method is a built-in JavaScript function that formats a number using fixed-point notation. It's particularly useful when you need to control the number of decimal places in a number, especially for displaying currency values or when working with precise measurements.

The `.toFixed()` method is called on a number and takes one optional argument, which is the number of digits to appear after the decimal point. It returns a string representation of the number with the specified number of decimal places. Here's a basic example of how `.toFixed()` works:


```js
let num = 3.14159;
console.log(num.toFixed(2)); // Output: "3.14"
```

In this case, we're limiting the number of decimal places to two. So, `3.14159` becomes `3.14`. It's important to note that `.toFixed()` returns a string, not a number. This is because the method is primarily intended for formatting numbers for display, not for further calculations.

The `.toFixed()` method rounds the number to the nearest value that can be represented with the specified number of decimal places. This rounding behavior is important to understand:


```js
console.log((3.14159).toFixed(3));  // Output: "3.142"
console.log((3.14449).toFixed(3));  // Output: "3.144"
console.log((3.14550).toFixed(3));  // Output: "3.146"
```

As you can see, `.toFixed()` rounds up when the next digit is `5` or greater, and rounds down otherwise. If you call `.toFixed()` without arguments, it defaults to `0` decimal places:


```js
let num = 3.14159;
console.log(num.toFixed()); // Output: "3"
```

The `.toFixed()` method can be particularly useful when working with financial calculations or displaying prices:


```js
let price = 19.99;
let taxRate = 0.08;
let total = price + (price * taxRate);

console.log("Total: $" + total.toFixed(2)); // Output: "Total: $21.59"
```

In this example, `.toFixed(2)` ensures that the total is always displayed with two decimal places, which is standard for currency in many countries.

In conclusion, the `.toFixed()` method is a powerful tool for formatting numbers in JavaScript, particularly when you need to control the display of decimal places. While it's primarily used for formatting output, remember its behavior, especially when precise calculations are needed.

# 2. Working with Common Array Methods

## 2.1. How do you get the index for an element in an array using the `indexOf` method?

In JavaScript, the `indexOf()` method is useful for finding the first index of a specific element within an array. If the element cannot be found, then it will return `-1`. Here is the basic syntax:

```js
array.indexOf(element, fromIndex)
```

`element` represents the value you want to search for within the array, and the `fromIndex` parameter is the position from which the search should start. The `fromIndex` parameter is optional. If `fromIndex` is not provided, the search starts from the beginning of the array. Let's look at an example:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "banana"];
let index = fruits.indexOf("banana");
console.log(index); // 1
```

In this example, we have an array `fruits` containing various fruit names. We use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the string `banana` within the `fruits` array. Since `banana` is present at index `1`, the method returns `1`, which is stored in the `index` variable and logged to the console.

If the element you're searching for is not found in the array, `indexOf()` returns `-1`. For example:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let index = fruits.indexOf("grape");
console.log(index); // -1
```

Here, we search for the string `grape` in the fruits array using `indexOf()`. Since `grape` is not present in the array, the method returns `-1`, which is stored in the `index` variable and logged to the console.

If you want to start looking for an item after a specific index number, then you can pass a second argument like in this example:

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "green"];
let index = colors.indexOf("green", 3);
console.log(index); // 4
```

In this example, the search does not start from the start of an array, rather it starts from the index number `3` which is `yellow` and gets the output of `4`.

## 2.2. How do you add/remove elements from the middle of an array?

The `splice()` method in JavaScript is a powerful way for modifying arrays. It allows you to add or remove elements from any position in an array, including the middle. The return value for the `splice()` method will be an array of the items removed from the array. If nothing was removed, then an empty array will be returned.

It is important to note that this method will mutate the original array, modifying it in place rather than creating a new array. This is something to be aware of when working with `splice()`. Here is the basic syntax:

```js
array.splice(startIndex, itemsToRemove, item1, item2)
```

`startIndex` specifies the index at which to begin modifying the array, while `itemsToRemove` is an optional parameter indicating how many elements to remove. If `itemsToRemove` is omitted, `splice()` will remove all elements from `startIndex` to the end of the array. The subsequent parameters (`item1`, `item2`, and so on) are the elements to be added to the array, beginning at the start index.

Let's start with an example of removing elements from the middle of an array:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "kiwi"];
let removed = fruits.splice(2, 2);

console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
console.log(removed); // ["orange", "mango"]
```

In this example, `splice(2, 2)` starts at index `2` and removes `2` elements. The modified array will now consist of only `apple`, `banana`, and `kiwi`. Now, let's look at how to add elements to the middle of an array:

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
colors.splice(1, 0, "yellow", "purple");

console.log(colors); // ["red", "yellow", "purple", "green", "blue"]
```

Here, `splice(1, 0, "yellow", "purple")` starts at index `1`, removes `0` elements, and inserts `yellow` and `purple`. The second parameter (`0`) means no elements are removed before insertion. You can also use `splice()` to simultaneously remove and add elements:

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.splice(1, 2, 6, 7, 8);

console.log(numbers); // [1, 6, 7, 8, 4, 5]
```

In this case, `splice(1, 2, 6, 7, 8)` starts at index `1`, removes `2` elements (`2` and `3`), and inserts `6`, `7`, and `8`. If you need to keep the original array unchanged, you should create a copy before using `splice()`:

```js
let original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let copy = [...original];
copy.splice(2, 1, 6);

console.log(original); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(copy);     // [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]
```

In this example, to create a copy of the `original` array without modifying it, we use the spread operator (`...`). The spread operator will create a shallow copy of the elements of the `original` array into a new array. You will learn more about this in future lecture videos.

When we use `copy.splice(2, 1, 6)`, it modifies the copy array by removing the element at index `2` (which is `3`) and inserting the new element `6` at that position.

One common use case for `splice()` is to remove a single element from an array when you know its index:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"];
let indexToRemove = fruits.indexOf("orange");
if (indexToRemove !== -1) {
    fruits.splice(indexToRemove, 1);
}

console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
```

In this example, we first use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the element `orange` in the `fruits` array. The `indexOf()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the given element or `-1` if the element is not found in the array.

We then compare `indexToRemove` with `-1` to ensure that the element exists in the array before attempting to remove it. If `indexToRemove` is not equal to `-1` (meaning the element is found), we use `splice()` to remove one element starting from the `indexToRemove` position.

You can also use `splice()` to clear an array by removing all elements:

```js
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.splice(0);

console.log(array); // []
```

While `splice()` is powerful, it's worth noting that for very large arrays, it can be less efficient than other methods, especially when modifying the beginning of the array. This is because `splice()` may need to shift all subsequent elements. In such cases, if you're only adding or removing elements at the end of the array, methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `unshift()`, and `shift()` might be more appropriate.

In conclusion, the `splice()` method is a versatile way for modifying arrays in JavaScript. It allows for precise control over adding and removing elements from any position in an array. Understanding how to use `splice()` effectively can greatly enhance your ability to manipulate arrays in your JavaScript code.

## 2.3. How can you check if an array contains a certain value?

In JavaScript, the `includes()` method is a simple and efficient way to check if an array contains a specific value. This method returns a boolean value: `true` if the array contains the specified element, and `false` otherwise.

The `includes()` method is particularly useful when you need to quickly verify the presence of an element in an array without needing to know its exact position. Let's start with an example of how to use the `includes()` method:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"];
console.log(fruits.includes("banana")); // true
console.log(fruits.includes("grape"));  // false
```

In this example, we have an array of fruits. We use the `includes()` method to check if `banana` is in the array. It returns `true` because `banana` is indeed present. We then check for `grape`, which returns `false` because it's not in the array.

The `includes()` method is case-sensitive when dealing with strings. This means that `Banana` with a capital B and `banana` with all lowercase letters are considered different values. Here's an example that illustrates this:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
console.log(fruits.includes("banana")); // true
console.log(fruits.includes("Banana")); // false
```

In this case, `banana` (all in lowercase) is found in the array, but `Banana` (with the first letter capitalized) is not, so the second `includes()` call returns `false`.

The `includes()` method can also accept an optional second parameter that specifies the position in the array to start the search. This is useful if you want to check for an element's presence in a specific part of the array. Here's how you can use this feature:

```js
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
console.log(numbers.includes(30, 2)); // true
console.log(numbers.includes(30, 4)); // false
```

For the first `console.log`, we are looking for the number `30` starting at index `3`. In this case, there is a number `30` that appears after index `3`, so the `includes()` method returns `true`.

The same is true for the second `console.log`. We are looking for the number `30` starting at index `4`. Since the number `30` does appear after that index, then it will return `true`.

It's worth noting that `includes()` uses the strict equality comparison (`===`), which means it can distinguish between different types. For example:

```js
let mixedArray = [1, "2", 3, "4", 5];
console.log(mixedArray.includes(2));  // false
console.log(mixedArray.includes("2")); // true
```

In this case, the number `2` and the string `"2"` are considered different data types. So, the first `console.log` will return `false`, while the second `console.log` will return `true`.

The `includes()` method is a powerful tool for checking the presence of elements in arrays. It's simple to use, efficient, and can save you from writing more complex loops or conditions to search through arrays. Whether you're working with strings, numbers, or mixed data types, `includes()` provides a straightforward way to verify if a value exists in your array.

## 2.4. What is a shallow copy of an array and what are some ways to create these copies?

A shallow copy of an array is a new array that contains references to the same elements as the original array. Creating shallow copies of arrays is a common operation, especially when you want to manipulate an array without modifying the original.

There are several methods for creating shallow copies of arrays, and we'll explore some of the most common ones: `concat()`, `slice()`, and the spread operator.

1. Let's start with the `concat()` method. This method creates a new array by merging two or more arrays. When used with a single array, it effectively creates a shallow copy. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
    let copyArray = [].concat(originalArray);

    console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
    console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
    ```

    In this example, we are using the `concat()` method to concatenate an empty array to the `originalArray`. This will create a new array that is a shallow copy of `originalArray`.

    The `copyArray` contains the same elements as `originalArray`, but it is a different array object, which is why the strict equality check (`===`) returns `false`.

2. Another method to create a shallow copy is the `slice()` method. When called without arguments, `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the entire array. Here's how it works:

    ```js
    let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
    let copyArray = originalArray.slice();

    console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
    console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
    ```

    In this case, `originalArray.slice()` creates a new array that is a shallow copy of `originalArray`. Again, the `copyArray` contains the same elements but is a different array object.

3. The spread operator (`...`), introduced in ES6, provides another concise way to create shallow copies of arrays. Here's an example:

    ```js
    let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
    let copyArray = [...originalArray];

    console.log(copyArray); // [1, 2, 3]
    console.log(copyArray === originalArray); // false
    ```

    The spread operator (`...`) spreads the elements of `originalArray` into a new array, effectively creating a shallow copy. 
    
It's important to note that all these methods create new array objects, which means you can modify the copy without affecting the original array. For example:

```js
let originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
let copyArray = [...originalArray];

copyArray.push(4);
console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(copyArray);     // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, adding an element to `copyArray` doesn't affect `originalArray`.

In summary, shallow copies of arrays can be easily created using methods like `concat()`, `slice()`, or the spread operator. These methods are useful for creating new arrays that can be manipulated independently of the original array.

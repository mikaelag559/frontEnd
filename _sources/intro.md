# Welcome to my front end web development notes

These are the notes I took while attending the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're intended to help me study and remember what I've learnt so far. If you've found this by some strange chance, please note that I'm not the creator of the course, nor am I pretending to be.

This site was made possible thanks to [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

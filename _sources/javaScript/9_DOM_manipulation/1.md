# 1. Working with the DOM, Click Events and Web APIs - I

## 1.1. What is an API and what are web APIs?

API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. APIs establish a set of rules and protocols that allow software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data efficiently. You can think of them as constructs that allow developers to create more complex functionality based on simpler building blocks that are already implemented.

There are various types of APIs. Web APIs are specifically designed for web applications. There are different types of web APIs for client-side JavaScript development. They are not part of JavaScript itself.

These types of APIs are often divided into two main categories: browser APIs and third-party APIs.

- **Browser APIs** expose data from the browser. As a web developer, you can access and manipulate this data using JavaScript.

    They also provide access to various functionalities, such as manipulating the structure of the website, handling events, working with storage, and communicating with the network.

    Some examples of commonly used Browser APIs include:

    - The DOM API, which you can use to manipulate HTML elements, their styles, and attributes. It’s a core concept in web development.

    - The Storage API, to store data locally on the user’s device.

    - And more.

    There are various browser APIs that you can use to handle user interactions and to get more information from the browser, like the user's current location.

    You can also work with other types of elements, such as video and audio.

    Browser APIs can be helpful tools for building powerful web applications. They already come built into the browser.

- But you can also use **third-party APIs**, which are not built into the browser by default. To use them, you need to retrieve their code in some way. Typically, they come with detailed documentation explaining how to use their services.

    An example is the Google Maps API, which you can use to display interactive maps on your website.

    There are various types of third-party web APIs, including weather APIs, social media APIs, payment APIs, data APIs, translation APIs, and more. You just need to find the API that fits your needs.

Web APIs are essential tools for building modern web applications that can interact with various services and data sources.

## 1.2. What is the DOM and how do you access elements?

DOM stands for **Document Object Model**. It's a programming interface that lets us interact with HTML documents. With the DOM, you can add, modify, or delete elements on a webpage. You can even make your website interactive by making elements listen to and respond to events.

In the DOM, an HTML document is represented as a tree of nodes. Each node represents an HTML element from the HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>DOM Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>What is the DOM?</h1>
    <h2>Let's learn about the DOM</h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is a diagram representing the basic DOM structure of our example:

```none
Document
  |
  |--> HTML
        |
        |--> Head
        |     |
        |     |--> Title
        |
        |--> Body
              |--> H1
              |--> H2
```

Of course, this can be more detailed and complex based on the structure of the HTML markup of a webpage.

- The HTML document is the root node in the DOM hierarchy. It has one child node, the `html` element. This is the root element of the HTML document, since all other nodes descend from it.

    The `html` element has two children: `head` and `body`.

    - The `head` element contains metadata about the document. It provides essential information about the webpage.

    - The `body` element contains the visible content of the webpage.

You can access these elements with JavaScript, work with them in your code and even modify them dynamically. That's the power of the DOM and web APIs.

To access these elements in JavaScript, you can use `getElementById()` and `querySelector()` methods. These methods are web APIs because they provide standardized ways to interact with the DOM using JavaScript.

- With `getElementById()`, you can get an object that represents the HTML element with the specified `id`. Remember that `id`s must be unique in every HTML document, so this method will only return one `Element` object. Here you can see an example:

    ```js
    const container = document.getElementById("container");
    ```

    This line of JavaScript code gets an element with the `id` value of `container` and assigns that object to a JavaScript constant. You must pass the `id` within quotation marks as an argument. If you log this object to the console, you will see it in the output:

    ```js
    console.log(container); // <div id="container">...</div>
    ```

- `querySelector()` is broader than `getElementById()`. With `querySelector()`, you can get the first element in the HTML document that matches the CSS selector passed as argument. In this example, you will get the first element with the class `section` and assign it to a variable:

    ```js
    const section = document.querySelector(".section");
    ```

- You also have other methods to match multiple elements, like `getElementsByClassName()` and `querySelectorAll()`. You'll learn more about them in a coming module.


## 1.3. How do DOM nodes exist relative to each other in the DOM Tree?

Let's learn about DOM nodes and their relationships in the DOM tree.

Just as a real tree has large and small branches connected in a hierarchical structure, DOM nodes also have direct and indirect relationships with one another. We will use this example to illustrate these relationships:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>DOM Tree Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>List item 1</li>
      <li>List item 2</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's start with the direct relationships:
1. The **root** of the DOM tree is the `html` element. It's the top-level container for all the content of an HTML document. All other nodes are descendants of this root node.

2. Then, below the root node, we find other nodes in the hierarchy. A **parent node** is an element that contains other elements. A **child node** is an element that is contained within another element.

    In this example, the `body` element is the parent of the paragraph element while the paragraph element is a child of the `body` element. These elements are represented as nodes in the DOM tree with the same relationships.

3. Just like we have parent nodes and child nodes, we also have **sibling nodes**. Sibling nodes are elements that share the same parent. 

    In our example, two list item elements share the same unordered list parent, so they are siblings.

    Similarly, the `h1` and paragraph elements are siblings because they share the same parent, the `body` element.

We also have indirect relationships across different levels in the hierarchy. 

- **Descendant nodes** are elements that are contained within another element, either directly or indirectly. An element is considered a descendant of another one if it can be reached by going through the DOM tree downwards from its ancestor.

    In our example, the list item `li` elements are descendants of the `body` element, since they are indirectly contained within it.

- An **ancestor node** is an element that is higher up in the DOM tree hierarchy than another element. 

    In our example, the `body` element is an ancestor of the list item `li` elements.


## 1.4. What is the `querySelectorAll()` method and when should you use it?

You can use this method to get a list of all the DOM elements that match a specific CSS selector. This is how you can call the `querySelectorAll()` method:

```js
document.querySelectorAll(selectors);
```

Call it on the `document` object and pass a string with the CSS selectors as an argument. The argument must be a valid CSS selector string. Otherwise, a `SyntaxError` exception will be thrown.

`querySelectorAll()` returns a `NodeList` object, a collection of nodes that match the specified CSS selector. The list will contain one `Element` object for each element that matches the CSS selectors. If no matches are found, the list will be empty.

The elements will be in the order in which they appear in the HTML document. 

- For example, you can match all elements of a specific type:

    ```js
    document.querySelectorAll("div");
    ```

- All elements with a specific class:

    ```js
    document.querySelectorAll(".rounded");
    ```

- All elements with a specific ID:

    ```js
    document.querySelectorAll("#logo");
    ```

- Or all elements with a specific attribute, like all links that take users to a specific URL:

    ```js
    document.querySelectorAll("a[href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/']");
    ```

- You can also use more complex CSS selectors, like this one, which matches all list items within an unordered list element with the class `ingredients`:

    ```js
    document.querySelectorAll("ul.ingredients li");
    ```

Since the method will return a collection of nodes, you can assign this collection to a variable and use it in your programs to work with the individual elements, like you can see in this example with the general syntax:

```js
const matches = document.querySelectorAll(selectors); 
```

For example, if you have this unordered list with three list items:

```html
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Flour</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ul>
```

You can call the `querySelectorAll()` method to match all list items within the unordered list with the class `ingredients` and assign the return value to the `matches` constant:

```js
const matches = document.querySelectorAll("ul.ingredients li");
```

This will return a collection of three nodes. Each node represents a list item element:

```js
// NodeList(3)
{
  0: `<li>Flour</li>`,
  1: `<li>Cheese</li>`,
  2: `<li>Water</li>`,
  length: 3,
}
```

You can work with this collection exactly like you would work with any other JavaScript array.

- For example, you can show it in the console with `console.log()`:

    ```js
    console.log(matches);
    ```

- You can also check the length of the collection with the `length` property:

    ```js
    console.log(matches.length);
    ```

    The output will be an integer representing the number of nodes in the collection:

    ```md
    3
    ```

- You can also access the individual elements of the collection with their corresponding indices. The first element will be at index `0`:

    ```js
    console.log(matches[0]);
    console.log(matches[1]);
    console.log(matches[2]);
    ```

    This is the output:

    ```html
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    ```

    The elements are printed one by one on the console.

- You can also iterate over the elements with a `for` loop:

    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {
        console.log(matches[i]);    
    }
    ```

    The output will be exactly the same in this case. But this can be very powerful for working with all the elements of the collection.


## 1.5. How do you create new nodes using `innerHTML` and `createElement()`?

Let's see how you can create nodes with `innerHTML` and `createElement()`.

1. We'll start with `innerHTML`.

    `innerHTML` is a property of `Element` objects that you can use to set their HTML markup. With `innerHTML`, you can set the HTML structure of an existing element with a string, creating all the necessary nodes.

    This is an example. We have an empty `div` and we'll add some elements within it using the `innerHTML` property:

    ```html
    <div id="container">
        <!-- Add new elements here -->
    </div>
    ```

    1. First, we need to select the element by its ID:

        ```js
        const container = document.getElementById("container");
        ```

    2. Then, we set the `innerHTML` property of the container to a string. This string has to have all the markup necessary to represent the nodes and the structure that you want to create. You can think of it as writing HTML within a string.

        ```js
        container.innerHTML = "<ul><li>Cheese</li><li>Tomato</li></ul>";
        ```

        We will set the `innerHTML` of this element to an unordered list of pizza ingredients (cheese and tomato).

    You can also write the string on multiple lines if it makes the markup easier to understand. The important thing is that the markup accurately represents the HTML structure you want to create.

    After running this code, you will see the following HTML structure if you inspect your markup.

    ```html
    <div id="container">
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    ```

    The new nodes were created and added dynamically to the DOM after the string was parsed.

    > `innerHTML` can be very helpful for certain scenarios. However, it does have some security risks that you should be familiar with. You shouldn't use it if you won't have full control over the string.
    >
    > For example, if the string will be entered by the user, you shouldn't use `innerHTML` because the user might insert malicious content into your website. Because of this, it’s usually recommended to use `textContent` instead, to insert plain text.

2. Another way to create a new node is by using the `createElement()` method. With this new method, you can create a new element by specifying its tag name.

    1. For example, if you want to create an image element, you would pass the `img` tag as a string when calling this method:

        ```js
        document.createElement("img");
        ```

    2. And you can assign this new object to a variable:

        ```js
        const img = document.createElement("img");
        ```

        The `createElement()` method returns a new `HTMLElement` object if the document is an `HTMLDocument`. Else, it returns an `Element` object.

    3. Once you have this new element ready, you can add it to the DOM as a child of another existing element using the `appendChild()` method, or you can insert it at a specific location using other methods. Choose the one that best fits your needs.

Creating nodes with `innerHTML` and `createElement()` allows you to dynamically manipulate the structure and content of your websites. By combining these techniques, you can build interactive web applications.

## 1.6. What is the difference between `innerText`, `textContent` and `innerHTML`?

Let's learn about `innerText`, `textContent`, and `innerHTML`.

These are properties that you can access in JavaScript to get or change the content of an HTML element. Even if they may look very similar at first, they do have key differences. Choosing the right one depends on your specific use case, so let's dive in.

1. Let's start with `innerText`.

    `innerText` represents the visible text content of the HTML element and its descendants. This property doesn't include hidden text or HTML tags, only rendered text.

    For example, here you can see a `div` element that contains two paragraphs:

    ```html
    <div id="container">
        <p>Hello, World!</p>
        <p>I'm learning JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    ```

    If we get a reference to this HTML element in our JavaScript code using `getElementById()`, we can access the `innerText` property of this element:

    ```js
    const container = document.getElementById("container");
    console.log(container.innerText);
    ```

    This is the inner text of this element:

    ```md
    Hello, World!
    I'm learning JavaScript
    ```

    The property returns a string with the text contained within the element, including text from its descendants.

    - You should know that `innerText` only returns the text that is visible at the particular moment when the string is requested. If a child element is hidden, its text won't be visible.

        This is an example where the second paragraph is hidden:

        ```html
        <div id="container">
            <p>Hello, World!</p>
            <p hidden>I'm learning JavaScript</p>
        </div>
        ```

        If we try to log the `innerText` again, now the output won’t have the text of the second paragraph:

        ```js
        console.log(container.innerText);
        ```

        This will be the output:

        ```md
        Hello, World!
        ```

    You can set the `innerText` of an HTML element like this, but this will replace the existing text and add a line break element (`br`) element for every line break:

    ```js
    container.innerText = "JavaScript is awesome!";
    ```

    > Since `innerText` takes visibility into account, getting its value triggers a process called "reflow", that recalculates the position of certain elements on the website. This process can be computationally intensive, so you should avoid triggering it if possible.

2. Great. Now let's talk about `textContent`.

    `textContent` returns the plain text content of an element, including all the text within its descendants.

    The most important difference between `innerText` and `textContent` is that `textContent` always returns the full text content of an HTML element and its descendants, regardless of whether it's visible or hidden.

    Here we have the same example in HTML:

    ```html
    <div id="container">
        <p>Hello, World!</p>
        <p>I'm learning JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    ```

    If you try to access this property, you'll see the text of the element and its descendants as the output, keeping the indentation and spacing:

    ```js
    const container = document.getElementById("container");
    console.log(container.textContent);
    ```

    ```md
    Hello, World!
    I'm learning JavaScript
    ```

    If an HTML element is not visible, like you can see over here, where we’ve hidden the second paragraph, its text will still be included in this property:

    ```html
    <div id="container">
        <p>Hello, World!</p>
        <p hidden>I'm learning JavaScript</p>
    </div>
    ```

    You will see the same output:

    ```md
    Hello, World!
    I'm learning JavaScript
    ```

    `textContent` will also include the content of elements like `script` and `style`.

    If you try to replace the value of `textContent` on a node, it will remove all its child nodes and replace them with a single text node containing the new string:

    ```js
    const container = document.getElementById("container");
    container.textContent = "Hello, World!";
    ```

3. And finally, let's talk about how `textContent` and `innerText` differs from `innerHTML`.

    Remember that with `innerHTML` you can set the inner HTML content of an element. This is helpful for injecting new HTML into the DOM dynamically.

    However, remember that this poses a security risk if you don't have control over the string, such as strings containing data entered by the user. If that data is malicious, it can lead to serious security issues.

    To avoid this, it's recommended to use the `textContent` property to insert plain text instead.

The `innerText`, `textContent`, and `innerHTML` properties in JavaScript provide different ways to access and manipulate the content of HTML elements.

## 1.7. How do you add and remove nodes from the DOM with `appendChild()` and `removeChild()`?

There will be times where you will need to add or remove nodes from the DOM and there are a couple of Web APIs you can use.

In this lecture video, we will cover the `appendChild()` and `removeChild()` methods.

1. The `appendChild()` method is used to add a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.

    Here is the basic syntax for the `appendChild()` method:

    ```js
    parentNode.appendChild(newNode);
    ```

    Let's take a look at an example to better understand how to use the `appendChild()` method.

    In this example, we have an unordered list element with an ID of `desserts` inside the HTML. This list contains two list items of `Cake` and `Pie`:

    ```html
    <ul id="desserts">
        <li>Cake</li>
        <li>Pie</li>
    </ul>
    ```

    1. To access that list inside the JavaScript file, we can use the `getElementById()` method:

        ```js
        const dessertsList = document.getElementById("desserts");
        ```

        We have a variable called `dessertsList` that stores the reference to the `ul` element with the ID of `desserts`.

    2. Then we need to create a new list item element using the `createElement()` method:

        ```js
        const dessertsList = document.getElementById("desserts");
        const listItem = document.createElement("li");
        ```

        The following code will create a new list item element and store it in a variable called `listItem`.

    3. To add that node to the end of the list of children of the `ul` element, we can use the `appendChild()` method:

        ```js
        const dessertsList = document.getElementById("desserts");
        const listItem = document.createElement("li");

        dessertsList.appendChild(listItem);
        ```

        If you were to run this code, you will see that a new list item element is added to the end of the list of children of the `ul` element.

        The problem is that the new list item element is empty. 
    
    4. To add text content to the new list item element, you can use the `textContent` property:

        ```js
        const dessertsList = document.getElementById("desserts");
        const listItem = document.createElement("li");

        listItem.textContent = "Cookies";
        dessertsList.appendChild(listItem);
        ```

        Now the list will show `Cake`, `Pie`, and `Cookies`.

2. To remove a node from the DOM, you can use the `removeChild()` method.

    Here is the basic syntax for the `removeChild()` method:

    ```js
    parentNode.removeChild(childNode);
    ```

    Let's take look at an example where we want to remove that last paragraph element from this `section` element:

    ```html
    <section id="example-section">
        <h2>Example sub heading</h2>
        <p>first paragraph</p>
        <p>second paragraph</p>
    </section>
    ```

    1. We can access the `section` element inside of the JavaScript file using the `getElementById()` method:

        ```js
        const sectionEl = document.getElementById("example-section");
        ```

    2. Once we have the reference to the `section` element, we can then access that last paragraph using the `querySelector()` method:

        ```js
        const sectionEl = document.getElementById("example-section");
        const lastParagraph = document.querySelector("#example-section p:last-of-type");
        ```

        We are using the `:last-of-type` pseudo-class to select the last paragraph element inside the `section` element.

    3. Now that we have the parent and child nodes, we can remove the last paragraph element from the `section` element using the `removeChild()` method:

        ```js
        const sectionEl = document.getElementById("example-section");
        const lastParagraph = document.querySelector("#example-section p:last-of-type");

        sectionEl.removeChild(lastParagraph);
        ```

        Here is the new HTML markup after removing the last paragraph element:

        ```html
        <section id="example-section">
            <h2>Example sub heading</h2>
            <p>first paragraph</p>
        </section>
        ```

So, when might you want to add or remove nodes from the DOM?

If you're working with dynamic content, you might need to add or remove nodes from the DOM. Real world examples include shopping carts, to-do lists, and social media feeds.

## 1.8. How do the `Navigator`, `Window` and `Document` work?

When working with the DOM, you will often come across the `Navigator`, `Window`, and `Document` interfaces. An interface is a collection of methods and properties that define a particular object.

In this lecture, we will explore how these interfaces work and how you can use them in your web applications.

1. Let's start by looking at the `Navigator` interface.

    The `Navigator` interface provides information about the browser environment, such as the user agent string, the platform, and the version of the browser. A user agent string is a text string that identifies the browser and operating system being used.

    - Here is an example of how to access the user agent string using the `Navigator` interface:

        ```js
        console.log(navigator.userAgent);
        ```

        The result will be a string that contains information about the browser and operating system being used. Here is an example string that you might see:

        ```md
        Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/128.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
        ```

        This could be helpful if you want to display different content based on the user's browser or operating system.

    - Another useful property of the `Navigator` interface is the `language` property, which returns the language of the browser. You can use this property to display content in the user's preferred language.

        Here is an example of using the `language` property:

        ```js
        console.log(navigator.language);
        ```

        The result will be a string that contains the language code of the browser. If your preferred language is English, it will return `en-US`.

2. Next, let's look at the `Window` interface.

    The `Window` interface represents the browser window that contains the DOM document. It provides methods and properties for interacting with the browser window, such as resizing the window, opening new windows, and navigating to different URLs.

    - Here is an example of working with the `innerWidth` property of the `Window` interface:

        ```js
        console.log(window.innerWidth);
        ```

        The result will be the width of the browser window in pixels. For example, if the browser window is 800 pixels wide, it will return `800`.

    - Another example would be the `location` property of the `Window` interface, which provides information about the current URL of the browser window:

        ```js
        console.log(window.location);
        ```

        The result will be an object that contains information about the current URL, such as the protocol, hostname, and pathname.

    Most of the time you won't need to interact with the `Window` interface directly, as it is automatically available in the global scope of your JavaScript code.

    For example, you can access the `location` property directly without using the `window` object:

    ```js
    console.log(location);
    ```

    You will see the same results as before when you were using `window.location`.

3. Finally, let's look at the `Document` interface.

    The `Document` interface represents the DOM document that is displayed in the browser window. It provides methods and properties for interacting with the DOM, such as selecting elements, creating new elements, and modifying the content of elements.

    Here is an example of using the `document.children` property:

    ```js
    console.log(document.children);
    ```

    The result will be an `HTMLCollection` object that contains all the child elements of the document.


## 1.9. How do you add attributes with `setAttribute()`?

You have been used to working with attributes in your HTML and CSS projects. But did you know that you can add attributes to your HTML elements in your JavaScript file?

In this lecture, you will learn how to work with the `setAttribute()` method to add attributes to your HTML elements.

Here is the basic syntax:

```js
setAttribute(attribute, value);
```

Let's take a look at a few examples to better understand how to use the `setAttribute()` method.

1. In this first example, we have a `p` element inside the HTML:

    ```html
    <p id="para">I am a paragraph</p>
    ```

2. To add a `class` attribute we first need to access that `p` element using the `getElementById()` method. Then we can use the `setAttribute()` method to add the `class` attribute and set the value to `my-class`:

    ```js
    const para = document.getElementById("para");
    para.setAttribute("class", "my-class");
    ```

3. If we inspect the element inside the browser, we will see that the `class` attribute has been added to the `p` element.

If you have an existing attribute on an HTML element, you can update its value using the `setAttribute()` method.

1. In this example we have a `div` element with a `class` attribute set to `my-class`:

    ```html
    <div class="my-class"></div>
    ```

2. To update the `class` attribute value to example, we can use the `setAttribute()` method again:

    ```js
    const divEl = document.querySelector(".my-class");
    divEl.setAttribute("class", "example");
    ```

3. If we inspect the element inside the browser, we will see that the `class` attribute value has been updated to example.

So, what are some real-world examples of when to use the `setAttribute()` method?

- If you were building a dynamic image gallery, you might need to update the `src` attribute of an image element when a user clicks on a thumbnail.

- Another example would be if you're dealing with form validation and need to add certain attributes like `required` or `minlength` to an `input` element.

## 1.10. What is the `Event` object?

The `Event` object is a payload that triggers when a user interacts with your web page in some way. These interactions can be anything from clicking on a button or focusing an input to shaking their mobile device.

Like all JavaScript objects, the `Event` object has a number of properties that might be helpful. The properties available depend on the event that triggered this payload.

- All `Event` objects will have the `type` property. This property reveals the type of event that triggered the payload, such as `"keydown"` or `"click"`. These values will correspond to the same values you might pass to `addEventListener()`, where you can capture and utilize the `Event` object.

- `Event` objects will always have the `target` property. The `target` property is a reference to whatever object triggered the event. Most commonly, this will be some sort of `HTMLElement` object, or the `Document` or `Window` objects. But it can also be something more specific, like an `AudioContext`.

Events also have methods, which are functions exposed as properties on the object. 

- One commonly used method is `preventDefault()`, which prevents the default behavior of the event when called.

    If you want to handle form submissions yourself, for example, you might call `preventDefault()` to keep the browser from trying to submit the form data as a `POST` request. You will learn more about `POST` requests in future lecture videos.

- You'll also likely run in to the `stopPropagation()` method. This method prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to parent elements.

There are also a large number of properties that are specific to certain implementations of the `Event` object. For example, a `FetchEvent` will have a request property to contain the request that triggered the event.

If you are ever unsure of what properties are available, you can log the `Event` object in question or even check the documentation.

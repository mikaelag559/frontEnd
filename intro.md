# Welcome to my front end web development notes

These are my notes I took while attending the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They are meant to help me study and remember what I have learnt so far. Please, if you have found this by some weird chance, notice I am not the creator of the course, nor try to pretend so.

This web was possible thanks to [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

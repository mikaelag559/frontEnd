# 1. Working with the DOM, Click Events and Web APIs - II

## 1.11. What are events and how does the `addEventListener()` method work?

When the user clicks on a button or there is a change in a form, this is known as an event. In your programs, you will need to have a way to listen for these events and respond to them. The `addEventListener()` method is used to listen for events. It takes two arguments: the event you want to listen for and a function that will be called when the event occurs.

Here is the basic syntax:

```js
element.addEventListener("event", listener);
```

The element is the HTML element to monitor for events, and event specifies the type of event to listen for, such as `"click"`.

The listener is an object that will receive the notification when the event occurs. Most of the time, this will be a function that you define to handle the event.

Here is an example:

```js
element.addEventListener("click", () => {
    // code to run when the click event occurs
});
```

You can also choose to pass in a function reference like this:

```js
function handleClick() {
    // code to run when the click event occurs
}

element.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

Sometimes you may want to create a separate function to handle the event. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.

The listener argument can also be `null`, or it can be an object that uses the `EventListener` interface. The `EventListener` interface defines a single method called `handleEvent()`. This method is automatically called whenever the event you're listening for occurs. Using this interface allows the same object to handle multiple events if needed.

Most of the time, you won't need to use this interface, and you can instead pass in a function that will be called when the event occurs.

Now, let's take a look at an example to better understand how this works:

In this example, we have a `button` element with the id of `btn`:

```html
<button id="btn">Show alert</button>
```

We want to listen for the `"click"` event on this button and show an alert when the button is clicked.

We first need to access that `button` element in our JavaScript code. Then we need to add an event listener to listen for the click event and show an alert when the button is clicked:

```js
const btn = document.getElementById("btn");

btn.addEventListener("click", () => alert("You clicked the button"));
```

Now each time the button is clicked, the user will see an alert message displayed on the screen like this:

```md
You clicked the button
```

Another type of event that you can listen for is the `"input"` event. This event is triggered when the value of an input element changes.

Here is an example:

```html
<input type="text" id="input" placeholder="Type something" />
```

We want to listen for the input event on this input element and log the value of the input to the console each time the user types something.

We first need to access that `input` element in our JavaScript code. Then we need to add an event listener to listen for the input event and log the value of the input to the console each time the user types something:

```js
const input = document.getElementById("input");

input.addEventListener("input", () => {
    console.log(input.value);
});
```

Here is what the console will look like when the user types something in the input field:

```md
h
he
hel
hell
hello
```

There are many more events that you can listen for using the `addEventListener()` method. Some common events include `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `keydown`, `keyup`, and `submit`.

In future lectures, we will cover more events and how to use the `addEventListener()` method to listen for them.

## 1.12. How does the `removeEventListener()` method work?

In the previous lecture video, you learned how to work with `"click"` and `"input"` events by using the `addEventListener()` method. In this lecture video, you will learn how to remove event listeners using the `removeEventListener()` method.

The `removeEventListener()` method is used to remove an event listener that was previously added to an element using the `addEventListener()` method. This is useful when you want to stop listening for a particular event on an element.

Here is the basic syntax for the `removeEventListener()` method:

```js
element.removeEventListener("event", listener);
```

Just like the `addEventListener()` method, the `removeEventListener()` method takes two arguments: the event you want to remove and the listener function that was previously added.

There is also an additional optional third argument that can be passed to the `removeEventListener()` method. This argument can either be the `options` or `useCapture`.

- The `options` argument is an object that specifies the options for the event listener, such as whether the event listener should be passive or once.

- The `useCapture` argument is a boolean value that specifies whether the event should be captured during the event propagation phase.

Most of the time, you will only need to pass the event and listener arguments to the `removeEventListener()` method.

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how the `removeEventListener()` method works:

1. In this example, we have heading, paragraph and button elements in the HTML:

    ```html
    <h1>Event Listener examples</h1>
    <p id="para">MouseOver this text to remove the event listener</p>
    <button id="btn">Change background color</button>
    ```

2. Inside the CSS file, we are setting the `body` background color to grey:

    ```css
    body {
        background-color: grey;
    }
    ```

3. If we want to toggle the background color between grey and blue, then we can use an event listener for that.

    We first need to access the paragraph and button elements along with the `body` element:

    ```js
    const bodyEl = document.querySelector("body");
    const para = document.getElementById("para");
    const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
    ```

4. Then we need to create the function responsible for toggling between the grey and blue colors:

    ```js
    let isBgColorGrey = true;

    function toggleBgColor() {
        bodyEl.style.backgroundColor = isBgColorGrey ? "blue" : "grey";
        isBgColorGrey = !isBgColorGrey;
    }
    ```

    We are using a boolean variable `isBgColorGrey` to keep track of the current background color. If the background color is grey, then we change it to blue, and vice versa.

5. Then we need to add an event listener to the `button` element to call the `toggleBgColor` function when the button is clicked:

    ```js
    btn.addEventListener("click", toggleBgColor);
    ```

    Each time the button is clicked, the background color of the body will change between grey and blue.

6. To remove the event listener when the paragraph is hovered over, we can add an event listener to the paragraph element. We are using the `mouseover` event and passing in a function that removes the event listener from the `button` element:

    ```js
    para.addEventListener("mouseover", () => {
        btn.removeEventListener("click", toggleBgColor);
    });
    ```

6. When the paragraph is hovered over, the event listener for the button click event is removed, and the background color will no longer change when the button is clicked.

Real world examples of when to use the `removeEventListener()` method include removing event listeners when a modal is closed in a web application or when a user logs out of an application.

## 1.13. What are inline event handlers and why is it best practice to use `addEventListener()` instead?

In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to work with events by using the `addEventListener()` method. But there is another, not recommended way, to work with events in JavaScript.

Inline event handlers are special attributes on an HTML element that are used to execute JavaScript code when an event occurs.

- Here is an example of a `button` element with an inline click event handler:

    ```html
    <button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Show alert</button>
    ```

    When the user clicks on the button, the `alert` function is called and an alert dialog is displayed with the message `Hello World!`.

- Another way to use inline event handlers is to call a function that is defined in a `script` tag in the HTML document.

    Here is an example of defining a function called `changeBgColor` and calling it from an inline click event handler:

    ```html
    <script>
        function changeBgColor() {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = "lightblue";
        }
    </script>

    <button onclick="changeBgColor()">Change background color</button>
    ```

    When the user clicks on the button, the `changeBgColor` function is called and the background color of the page is changed to light blue. 
    
While it is possible to use inline event handlers like this, it is not considered a best practice.

- For one reason, inline event handlers can only be used to attach one event listener to an element. If you want to attach multiple event listeners to the same element, you will need to use `addEventListener()`. 

- Another reason is that inline event handlers mix HTML and JavaScript code together, which can make your code harder to read and maintain. It is better to keep your HTML code and JavaScript code separate by using `addEventListener()` to attach event listeners to elements.

> Inline event handlers are not recommended for use in modern JavaScript. So, it is best practice to stick with the `addEventListener()` method when working with events in JavaScript.

## 1.14. How do you manipulate styles using `Element.style` and `Element.classList`?

There will be times when you will need to manipulate the styles of an HTML element inside your JavaScript file. An example of this would be when you need to hide or show a menu when a user clicks on a button.

In this lecture, you will learn how to manipulate styles using the `Element.style` and `Element.classList` properties.

1. The `Element.style` property is a read-only property that represents the inline style of an element. You can use this property to get or set the style of an element.

    Here is an example of a paragraph element with an ID of `para`:

    ```html
    <p id="para">This is a paragraph</p>
    ```

    You can use the `style` property to change the color of the paragraph element to red:

    ```js
    const paraEl = document.getElementById("para");
    paraEl.style.color = "red";
    ```

    The `style` property can be used to set many CSS properties, such as `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and so on.

2. Another way to manipulate styles is by using the `Element.classList` property. The `classList` property is a read-only property that can be used to add, remove, or toggle classes on an element. Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

    - In this first example, you are going to add a class called `highlight` to a paragraph element with an ID of `para`:

        ```html
        <p id="para">This is a paragraph</p>
        ```

        In the CSS, we will set the `highlight` class to change the background color of the paragraph element to yellow:

        ```css
        .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
        }
        ```

        In the JavaScript, we will add the `highlight` class to the paragraph element using the `classList.add()` method:

        ```js
        const paraEl = document.getElementById("para");
        paraEl.classList.add("highlight");
        ```

    - You can also add multiple classes to an element by passing them as arguments to the `classList.add()` method:

        ```js
        classList.add("class1", "class2", "class3");
        ```

    - If you need to remove a class from an element, you can use the `classList.remove()` method like this:

        ```js
        classList.remove("highlight");
        ```

    - To toggle a class on an element, you can use the `classList.toggle()` method. In this example, we have a `button` element with an ID of `toggle-btn` and a `nav` element with an ID of `menu`:

        ```html
        <button id="toggle-btn">Toggle Menu</button>

        <nav id="menu" class="menu">
            <ul>
                <li>Home</li>
                <li>About</li>
                <li>Products</li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
        ```

        Inside the CSS, we have added some styles for the menu and a class called `show` that will change the `display` property of the `.menu` to `block`:

        ```css
        .menu {
            display: none;
            background-color: lightgray;
            width: 50%;
            padding: 10px;
        }

        .menu.show {
            display: block;
        }
        ```

        Inside the JavaScript, we are accessing the menu element and the `button` element using the `getElementById()` method. Then, we are adding an event listener to the `button` element that will toggle the `show` class on the `.menu` element when the button is clicked:

        ```js
        const menu = document.getElementById("menu");
        const toggleBtn = document.getElementById("toggle-btn");

        toggleBtn.addEventListener("click", () => menu.classList.toggle("show"));
        ```

        When a user clicks on the button, the `show` class will be added to the `.menu` element, and the menu will be displayed. If the user clicks on the button again, the `show` class will be removed from the `.menu` element, and the menu will be hidden.

By using methods and properties such as `style`, `add()`, `remove()`, and `toggle()`, you can easily manipulate an element's styles with JavaScript, creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

## 1.15. What is the `DOMContentLoaded` event and how does it work?

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when everything in the HTML document has been loaded and parsed. If you have external stylesheets, or images, the `DOMContentLoaded` event will not wait for those to be loaded. It will only wait for the HTML to be loaded.

This differs from the `load` event, which waits for everything to be loaded, including external stylesheets, images, and so on.

- Here is the example syntax for using the `DOMContentLoaded` event:

    ```js
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
        console.log("DOM is loaded.");
    });
    ```

    Once the DOM is loaded, the function will be executed and the message `DOM is loaded.` will be logged to the console.

- Now, let's take a look at another example using the `DOMContentLoaded` event. In this example, we have an image inside the HTML:

    ```html
    <h1>Image Change on DOM Loaded</h1>
    <img
        id="example-img"
        src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
        alt="Cat relaxing"
    />
    ```

    To update the image, we can create a function that changes the `src` attribute of the image:

    ```js
    function changeImg() {
        const img = document.getElementById("example-img");
        img.src =
            "https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/responsive-web-design-principles/FCCStickers-CamperBot200x200.jpg";
        console.log("image was just changed");
    }
    ```

    We can then check if the DOM is still loading and add an event listener for the `DOMContentLoaded` event. If the `DOMContentLoaded` event has already fired, we can call the `changeImg` function directly:

    ```js
    if (document.readyState === "loading") {
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", changeImg);
    } else {
        console.log("DOMContentLoaded has already fired");
        changeImg();
    }
    ```

    If you were to run this code, and refresh the page, you would see the image change to the new image after the DOM has loaded. It happens pretty quickly, but you will see a slight flicker as the image changes.

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is useful when you want to run some JavaScript code as soon as the DOM is loaded, but before all the external resources like images and stylesheets are loaded.

## 1.16. How do the `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` methods work?

When building your programs, you'll often want something to happen after a delay, or repeat at regular intervals. That's where the `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` methods come in handy. Both methods accept two parameters: a function and a delay.

1. `setTimeout()` lets you delay an action for a specified time. Here's the basic syntax of the `setTimeout()` method:

    ```js
    setTimeout(functionToRun, delay);
    ```

    `functionToRun` is the code you want to execute after a specified delay, and `delay` is the time (in milliseconds) to wait before running the function. Here's an example:

    ```js
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("This runs after 3 seconds");
    }, 3000);
    ```

    You can also use an arrow function for the callback, like this:

    ```js
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("This runs after 3 seconds"); 
    }, 3000);
    ```

2. `setInterval()` keeps repeating a function at a set interval. It's like having an alarm that goes off every few seconds. `setInterval()` is perfect when you want something to happen over and over again, like refreshing data or creating an animation that moves continuously.

    Just like `setTimeout()`, it takes a function and a delay:

    ```js
    setInterval(functionToRun, delay);
    ```

    `functionToRun` is the code you want to run repeatedly, while `delay` is the time in milliseconds between each execution of that function. 
    
    - Here's an example:

        ```js
        setInterval(() => {
            console.log("This runs every 2 seconds");
        }, 2000);
        ```

        And here's the result in the console:

        ```md
        This runs every 2 seconds
        This runs every 2 seconds
        This runs every 2 seconds
        ```

    Since `setInterval()` keeps executing the provided function at the specified interval, you might want to stop it. To do this, you have to use the `clearInterval()` method.

    To do the work, `clearInterval()` takes the ID of the `setInterval()` you want to stop. This could be a variable you assign the interval to. One way to stop the interval is inside a `setTimeout()`, as that will stop the interval after a certain time:

    ```js
    const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("This will stop after 5 seconds");
    }, 1000);

    setTimeout(() => {
        clearInterval(intervalID);
    }, 5000);
    ```

    You can also stop a timeout with the `clearTimeout()` method:

    ```js
    let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("This will not run");
    }, 5000);

    clearTimeout(timeoutID);
    ```

    With that code, the `setTimeout()` will not run at all. So, a more elegant way to do it is through the DOM, by adding a click event listener to a button to stop the timeout:

    ```html
    <h1>Cancel Timeout Example</h1>
    <button id="cancelButton">Cancel Timeout</button>

    <script>
        let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("This will run if not canceled");
        }, 5000);

        document
        .querySelector("#cancelButton")
        .addEventListener("click", () => {
            clearTimeout(timeoutID);
            console.log("Timeout canceled!");
        });
    </script>
    ```

## 1.17. What is the `requestAnimationFrame()` API and how can it be used to set up an animation loop?

Creating smooth animations on a web page can be tricky, especially if you're not sure how to handle timing properly. The great news is that the `requestAnimationFrame()` API makes it easier. 

`requestAnimationFrame()` is a method that allows you to schedule the next step of your animation before the next screen repaint, resulting in a fluid and visually appealing experience.

The next screen repaint refers to the moment when the browser refreshes the visual display of the web page. This happens multiple times per second, typically around 60 times (or 60 frames per second) on most displays.

To use the `requestAnimationFrame()` method, all you need to do is to call it and pass a callback function into it:

```js
requestAnimationFrame(callback);
```

- Calling `requestAnimationFrame()` must first occur inside a function that handles the animation, such as `animate()`, along with a function to update the animation, traditionally called `update()`:

    ```js
    function animate() {
        // Update the animation...
        // for example, move an element, change a style, and more.
        update();
        // Request the next frame
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }
    ```

    The `update()` function is where the magic happens. Inside it, you get to change whatever you want to animate. For example, updating a style or changing the position of an element:

    ```js
    function update() {
        element.style.transform = `translateX(${position}px)`;
        position += 2;
    }
    ```

    What finally kicks off the animation is calling `requestAnimationFrame()` and passing in the `animate` function, this time outside the `animate` function:

    ```js
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    ```

    The loop will continue until you stop it.

- Now, let's take a look at another example. The HTML for this example is a `div` element with the text `freeCodeCamp is Awesome`:

    ```html
    <div id="rect" class="rect">freeCodeCamp is Awesome</div>
    ```

    This is the CSS that makes the `div` a rectangle and hides anything that goes out of the viewport on the left or right:

    ```css
    body {
        overflow-x: hidden;
    }

    .rect {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        width: 400px;
        height: 250px;
        border-radius: 5px;
        background-color: #1b1b32;
        color: #f5f6f7;
        font-size: 2rem;
        position: absolute;
    }
    ```

    This is the commented JavaScript that moves the rectangle `2px` to the right at every call of `requestAnimationFrame(animate)` with the `animate` function as a callback:

    ```js
    // reference the rectangle
    const rect = document.getElementById("rect");

    // start with a position of 0
    let position = 0;

    function update() {
        // Move the rectangle 2px to the right
        rect.style.left = position + "px";
        position += 2;

        // Reset the position when the rectangle reaches
        // the right side of the screen
        if (position > window.innerWidth) {
            // Move the rectangle just outside the left side of the screen
            position = -rect.offsetWidth;
        }
    }

    function animate() {
        // Update the position
        update();

        //request the next frame
        requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }

    // Start the animation
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    ```

The result in the browser will be an animated title card floating across the screen.

## 1.18. What is the `Web Animations` API and how does it relate to CSS animation properties?

The `Web Animations` API (WAAPI) allows you to create and control animations directly within JavaScript. With WAAPI, you can work with animations more dynamically, making it easier to manipulate them.

Let's take a look at WAAPI in more detail, so you can start working with animations directly inside your JavaScript code. At the core of WAAPI is the `Animation` constructor, which provides several instance methods and properties that allow you to dynamically animate elements.

A significant method in the `Animation` constructor is `animate()`. It allows you to create an animation by specifying keyframes and options like duration, directions easing, and iterations.

Here's the basic syntax of the `animate()` method:

```js
element.animate(keyframes, options);
```

- Let's look at an example. Here's a `div` element for the HTML:

    ```html
    <div class="square" id="square"></div>
    ```

    Here's the CSS that makes the `div` a square and centers everything on the page:

    ```css
    body {
        background: #f1f1f1;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        height: 100vh;
    }

    .square {
        background: #1b1b32;
        width: 10rem;
        aspect-ratio: 1/1;
    }
    ```

    And here's the JavaScript that uses the `animate()` method:

    ```js
    const square = document.querySelector("#square");

    const animation = square.animate(
        [{ transform: "translateX(0px)" }, { transform: "translateX(100px)" }],
        {
            duration: 2000, // makes animation lasts 2 seconds
            iterations: Infinity, // loops indefinitely
            direction: "alternate", // moves back and forth
            easing: "ease-in-out" // smooth easing
        }
    );
    ```

    The result in the browser will be a blue square moving back and forth horizontally.

The instance methods of the `Animation` constructor include:

```js
play()
pause()
reverse()
finish()
cancel()
```

And the instance properties include:

```md
playbackRate
currentTime
startTime
effect
timeline
playState
finished
onfinish
oncancel
```

- Let's modify the example to use the `play()`, `pause()` methods and the `onfinish` property. Here's the HTML with play and pause buttons:

    ```html
    <div class="square" id="square"></div>

    <button id="playBtn">Play</button>
    <button id="pauseBtn">Pause</button>
    ```

    Here's the new CSS:

    ```css
    body {
        background: #f1f1f1;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        height: 100vh;
    }
    .square {
        background: #1b1b32;
        width: 10rem;
        aspect-ratio: 1/1;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    button {
        margin: 10px;
        padding: 10px 20px;
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

    And here's the new JavaScript:

    ```js
    const square = document.querySelector("#square");
    const playBtn = document.querySelector("#playBtn");
    const pauseBtn = document.querySelector("#pauseBtn");

    const animation = square.animate(
        [{ transform: "translateX(0px)" }, { transform: "translateX(200px)" }],
        {
            duration: 5000, // Animation lasts 5 seconds
            // iterations: Infinity, // Loops indefinitely
            direction: "alternate", // Moves back and forth
            easing: "ease-in-out" // Smooth easing function
        }
    );

    // Set the onfinish property to log a message when the animation ends
    animation.onfinish = () => {
        console.log("Animation finished!");
    };

    // Play the animation when the "Play" button is clicked
    playBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        animation.play();
        console.log("You start the animation");
    });

    // Pause the animation when the "Pause" button is clicked
    pauseBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        animation.pause();
        console.log("You pause the animation");
    });
    ```

    The result in the browser will show the blue box moving from left to right when the `play` button is clicked.

WAAPI extends the capabilities of CSS animations by providing more dynamic control over animations right inside JavaScript.

With CSS animations, you define animations declaratively using properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-timing-function`. You also have the opportunity to do the same thing using the `animate()` method of WAAPI.

The difference is that you can control the animations you create with the `animate()` method more directly and dynamically, but with CSS animations, you need to do way more by defining custom styles and triggering them inside your JavaScript file.

CSS animation is ideal for simple and declarative animations that run automatically. Those include hover effects, transitions or animations that don't need much interaction once triggered. If your animation needs to respond to user interactions like clicks, and scrolls, or you want the user to be able to pause, reverse, or change speed dynamically, WAAPI is the better choice. 

You can consider combining both WAAPI and CSS animations when you want the simplicity of CSS for basic setup but need to control animations at runtime.

## 1.19. What is the `Canvas` API and how does it work?

The `Canvas` API is a powerful tool that lets you manipulate graphics right inside your JavaScript file. Everything begins with a `canvas` element in HTML. This element serves as a drawing surface that you can manipulate using the instance methods and properties of the `Canvas` API.

The `Canvas` API provides everything you need to create amazing visuals, including shapes, text, animations, and even complex games. It has interfaces like `HTMLCanvasElement`, `CanvasRenderingContext2D`, `CanvasGradient`, `CanvasPattern`, `TextMetrics` which provide methods and properties you can use to create graphics in your JavaScript file.

Let's look at how the `Canvas` API works so you can start creating graphics with JavaScript.

1. First, you need to create a `canvas` element in your HTML file:

    ```html
    <canvas id="my-canvas"></canvas>
    ```

    The `canvas` element is represented by the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface, which provides methods and properties for manipulating it. Additionally, you can use methods and properties from other interfaces in the `Canvas` API.

    You can give your `canvas` a `width` and `height` inside the HTML:

    ```html
    <canvas id="my-canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
    ```

    Or you can use the `width` and `height` properties of the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface:

    ```js
    const canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas");
    canvas.width = 400;
    canvas.height = 400;
    ```

    For now, you can't see anything on the screen yet. 
    
2. After creating your `canvas` element, the next thing to do is to get access to the drawing context of the canvas with the `getContext()` method of the `HTMLCanvasElement` interface. 

    The most common context is `2d`, which allows you to draw in two dimensions:

    ```js
    const canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas");
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    ```

    If you log the `ctx` variable to the console, you'll see the methods and properties of `CanvasRenderingContext2D` that you can use to create shapes, colors, lines, and more, along with their default values:

    ```js
    console.log(ctx);

    /*
    canvas: canvas#my-canvas
    direction: "ltr
    fillStyle: "#000000"
    filter: "none"
    font: "10px sans-serif
    (...)
    */
    ```

3. Once you have the 2D context, you can start drawing on the canvas.

    The `Canvas` API provides several methods and properties for drawing shapes, lines, and text. One of those is the `fillStyle` property, which you can combine with the `fillRect()` method to draw a rectangle or square:

    ```js
    const canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas");

    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

    // Set the background color
    ctx.fillStyle = "crimson";

    // Draw a rectangle
    ctx.fillRect(1, 1, 150, 100);
    ```

    `fillRect` takes 4 number values which represent the x axis, y axis, width, and height, respectively.

    There's something on the screen now. 
    
4. You can also draw text or even create an animation. Here's a canvas to represent text:

    ```html
    <canvas id="my-text-canvas" width="300" height="70"></canvas>
    ```

5. To finally draw the text, pass the text into the `fillText()` method as the first argument, followed by the values for the x and y axis:

    ```js
    const textCanvas = document.getElementById("my-text-canvas");

    const textCanvasCtx = textCanvas.getContext("2d");

    // Set font family and size
    textCanvasCtx.font = "30px Arial";

    // Set text color
    textCanvasCtx.fillStyle = "crimson";

    // Draw the text
    textCanvasCtx.fillText("Hello HTML Canvas!", 1, 50);
    ```

    The result in the browser will be the red text `Hello HTML Canvas!`.

These's much more you can do with the `Canvas` API. For example, you can combine it with `requestAnimationFrame` to create custom animations, visualizations, games, and more.

## 1.20. How do you open and close `dialog` elements using JavaScript?

Dialogs let you display important information or actions to users. With HTML's built-in `dialog` element, you can easily create these dialogs (both modal and non-modal dialogs) in your web apps.

- A modal dialog is a type of dialog that forces the user to interact with it before they can access the rest of the application or webpage. It effectively blocks interaction with other content until the user completes an action, such as closing the dialog or submitting a form.

- In contrast, a non-modal dialog allows the user to continue interacting with other parts of the page or application even when the dialog is open. It doesn't prevent access to the rest of the content.

In this lecture, you will learn how to open and close modals using the `showModal()` and `close()` methods.

1. When you want to make sure the user focuses on a specific action or message of a modal, you can open the modal dialog using the `showModal()` method. This will add a backdrop to the other items on the page and disable them. This is ideal for modals that display forms, confirmations, and critical information that requires user action. 

    - Here's the HTML for the modal dialog:

        ```html
        <dialog id="my-modal">
            <p>This is a modal dialog.</p>
        </dialog>
        ```

        For now, you can't see anything on the page because the modal is closed on the initial render. You can automatically open the modal by using the `showModal()` method:

        ```js
        const dialog = document.getElementById("my-modal");
        dialog.showModal();
        ```

        The result in the browser will show a modal with the text `This is a modal dialog.`

    - It's best to give control to the user. To achieve this, you can add a click event listener to a button and use the `showModal()` method:

        ```html
        <dialog id="my-modal">
            <p>This is a modal dialog.</p>
        </dialog>
        <button id="open-modal">Open Modal Dialog</button>
        ```

        Here's the JavaScript:

        ```js
        const dialog = document.getElementById("my-modal");
        const openButton = document.getElementById("open-modal");

        openButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
            dialog.showModal();
        });
        ```

    - If you needed to show a dialog while still allowing interaction with content outside of the dialog, then you can use the `show()` method:

        ```js
        const dialog = document.getElementById("my-modal");
        const openButton = document.getElementById("open-modal");

        openButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
            dialog.show();
        });
        ```

2. To close a modal, you can add a button to the modal inside the `dialog` element:

    ```html
    <dialog id="my-modal">
        <p>This is a modal dialog.</p>
        <button id="close-modal">Close Modal</button>
    </dialog>
    <button id="open-modal">Open Modal Dialog</button>
    ```

    Then use the `close()` method on the button:

    ```js
    const dialog = document.getElementById("my-modal");
    const openButton = document.getElementById("open-modal");
    const closeButton = document.getElementById("close-modal");

    openButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
        dialog.show();
    });

    closeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
        dialog.close();
    });
    ```

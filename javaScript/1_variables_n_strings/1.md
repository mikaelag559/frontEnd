# 1. Introduction to JavaScript

## 1.1. What is JavaScript, and how does it work with HTML and CSS?

JavaScript is a powerful programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

While HTML and CSS are markup languages used to structure content and style elements on a page, JavaScript goes beyond those by enabling more complex functionality, such as handling user input, animating elements, and even building full web applications.

For example, when you click a button, submit a form, or hover over a menu, JavaScript determines how the page behaves.

Here's an example of how these three work together:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
    h1 {
        color: green;
    }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```
    
In this example, HTML is used to define the content: a heading (an `h1` tag) and a button (the `button` tag). CSS is used to apply styles to the heading, such as making the text green. JavaScript is used to display an alert message when the button is clicked.

To sum up, HTML provides structure, CSS adds styling, and JavaScript enables behavior, creating a complete and interactive web experience.

## 1.2. What is a data type, and what are the different data types in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, a data type refers to the kind of value a variable holds.

A variable is a named container that stores a value of a specific data type, allowing you to reference and manipulate it throughout your code. Data types help the program understand the kind of data it's working with, whether it's a number, text, or something else.

JavaScript has several basic data types that you'll use in your programs. We'll explore each data type in greater detail in future lecture videos. For now, here is a brief introduction of the different data types in JavaScript.

- The first data type we will look at is the `Number` type. A `Number` represents both integers and floating-point values. Examples of integers include `7`, `19`, and `90`. Examples of floating point numbers include `3.14` and `5.2`. A floating point number is a number with a decimal point.

- The next data type is a `String`. A `String` is a sequence of characters, or text, enclosed in quotes. Here are two examples:
    ```html
    "Hello, world"
    ```
        
    ```html
    'JavaScript'
    ```

- Another data type used in JavaScript is the `Boolean` type. A `Boolean` represents one of two possible values: `true` or `false`. You can use a boolean to check if a page is loading, or if a user is logged in or not.

- The next two data types used in JavaScript are `undefined` and `null`. `undefined` means a variable has been declared but hasn't been given a value yet. `null` means the variable has been intentionally set to "nothing" and does not hold any value. We will explore more on how this works in future lectures.

- The next data type we will look at is the `Object` type. An `Object` is a more complex data type that can hold collections of key-value pairs. Let's break this down. The key (also called a property name), is like a label for the data, whereas the value, is the actual data you want to store. Here is an example:

    ```JS
    let book = {
      title: "The Great Gatsby",
      author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
      year: 1925
    };
    ```

    In this object, `title`, `author`, and `year` are the keys (or property names). `The Great Gatsby`, `F. Scott Fitzgerald`, and `1925` are the corresponding values.

    Each key-value pair in an object is called a property. So we can say that this book object has three properties. This is just a basic introduction to objects and their properties. In future videos, we'll go deeper into more advanced concepts.

- A `Symbol` is a special type of value in JavaScript that is always unique and cannot be changed. It's often used to create unique labels or identifiers for properties:

    ```JS
    // Creating two symbols
    const symbol1 = Symbol('mySymbol');
    const symbol2 = Symbol('mySymbol');
    console.log(symbol1 === symbol2); // Outputs: false
    ```
    
    In this example, we create two symbols with the same description, but they are unique.

- `BigInt` is used for very large numbers that exceed the limit of the `Number` type:

    ```JS
    const bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    console.log(bigNumber);
    // Outputs: 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n
    ```

    In this example, we create a `BigInt` by adding `n` at the end of a very large number.

Understanding these data types helps you handle and work with various kinds of data in your programs, as each type has its own characteristics and behaviors.

## 1.3. What are variables, and what are guidelines for naming JavaScript variables?

In JavaScript, variables act as containers for storing data that you can access and modify throughout your program.

You can think of variables as boxes that hold values. With variables, you can keep track of things like numbers or text and refer to these values whenever you need them in your program.

One way to declare a variable in JavaScript, is to use the `let` keyword. You will learn more about the `let` keyword as well as other ways to declare variables in future lectures.

Here's an example of using `let` to declare a variable called `age`:

```JS
let age;
```
    
Right now, the `age` variable does not have a value assigned to it. To assign a value to a variable you will need to use the assignment operator like this:

```JS
let age = 25;
```
    
The assignment operator looks like an equals sign (`=`) but it doesn't check for equality. You'll learn about the correct operators for checking equality in future videos.

The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. This process of assigning a value to a variable is known as initialization.

One advantage of using the `let` keyword to declare variables is that you can reassign values to them. In programming, reassignment means giving a new value to a variable that already has one.

Here is an example of reassigning the value for the `age` variable:

```JS
let age = 25
age = 30;
```    

Now the `age` variable holds the value of `30`. Notice that the `let` keyword wasn't needed again because the `age` variable was already declared, so there's no need to declare it a second time.

When using reassignment, you only need to reference the variable name. Reassignment is useful because it allows you to update and change the value stored in a variable as your program runs. A good example of this would be updating points in a game.

Naming variables may seem straightforward, but there are some rules and best practices to ensure your code is readable and functional.

Your variable names should describe what the data represents. For example, instead of using a name like `x`, a more descriptive name such as `age` or `points` makes your code easier to understand.

Variables in JavaScript must begin with a letter, an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`). They cannot start with a number.

Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning the word `age` in all lowercase and the word `Age` with a capital `A` are considered different variables.

This is why it's important to stick with a consistent naming convention like camelCase. camelCase is where the first word is all lowercase and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.

Here is an example of using the camelCase naming convention for a variable:

```JS
let thisIsCamelCase;
```

There are certain keywords in JavaScript that you cannot use as variable names, such as `let`, `const`, `function`, or `return`, as they are reserved for the language itself.

You should also avoid using special characters like exclamation points (`!`) or at (`@`) symbols, in your variable names. It is best to keep variable names readable by using letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

By following these guidelines, your code will be cleaner and more manageable as it grows in complexity.

# 2. User-Centered Design

## 2.1. What is user-centered design?

User-centered design is a web development approach that prioritizes the end user, from their needs to their preferences and limitations. The goal of user-centered design is to craft a web page that is intuitive, efficient to use, and pleasing for your users to interact with.

One of the first aspects of user-centered design is considering your target demographics. For example, if your intended user-base is younger, you might leverage more flashy eye-catching designs that grab their attention immediately. For an older audience, you might focus more on clear and streamlined designs without distractions.

Another aspect to consider is the goal of your end users. For example, if you're building an e-commerce page for your products, you probably don't want to advertise someone else's products on your page. But if you're building a personal blog, you might include advertisement elements to generate revenue from passive readers.

User behavior is an important factor as well. You'll want to leverage an analytics tool, like Google Analytics, to measure how your users engage with your pages. This can reveal areas where users might be getting "stuck" and leaving your page, or opportunities to improve the overall interaction flow.

A key to user-centered design is to actually involve your users. Providing a feedback channel where they can share their experiences and pain points with your site allows you to capture vital information and iterate further to improve. Ultimately, user-centered design means you need to put the user at the forefront of your decision making, whether that's through research or direct feedback.

## 2.2. What is user research/testing and user requirements?

User research is the systematic study of the people who use your product. The goal is to measure user needs, behaviors, and pain points.

User research comes in many forms. Perhaps one of the most common is the Net Promoter Score, or NPS. The NPS measures how likely your users are to recommend your product to a friend. NPS is measured through a survey offered at key milestones along the user's journey, such as after 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days. NPS is measured on a scale of 0 to 10, with 9 and 10 indicating an active promoter of your site.

Another research vector is an exit interview. This is a survey you show to your users when they cancel a subscription or delete an account. Data from this survey can give you insight into the factors causing user churn, so you can address them.

User testing, on the other hand, refers to the practice of capturing data from users as they interface with your application. For example, a video game going through beta testing is a form of user testing. One you might run into as a web developer is A/B testing. A/B testing involves shipping a new feature to a randomly selected subset of your user base. You can then leverage analytics data to determine if the feature is beneficial.

Finally, user requirements refer to the stories or rubric that your application needs to follow. This can inform the development process. User requirements might be defined by user research, or industry standards. They can even be defined by stakeholder input.

These requirements may be functional, meaning they dictate how your application should work, or non-functional, meaning they define how your application should behave. User requirements are not static, either. The information from both user testing and user research can impact the requirements, and they will change as your user base changes.

Understanding the difference is essential for collecting the most accurate data so you can deliver the best experience for your end users.

## 2.3. What are best practices for designing a dark mode feature?

Dark mode is a special feature on web applications where you can change the default light color scheme to a dark color scheme. This helps reduce eye strain and improve readability in low-light conditions. When designing your dark mode features, it is important to understand best practices to ensure that your dark mode feature is effective and user-friendly.

The first consideration is the avoidance of saturated colors in dark mode. Saturated colors are colors that are bright and intense. For example, a bright magenta button against a dark gray background can be too intense and cause eye strain. Instead, you should use desaturated colors in dark mode. Desaturated colors are colors that are less intense, have a lower saturation level, and more comfortable to look at in dark mode.

Another consideration with dark mode is the use of pure black backgrounds with white text. While this high contrast can be effective, it can also be too harsh on the eyes. Instead, consider using a dark gray background with light gray text for a softer contrast. Text will be easier on the eyes and more comfortable to read in dark mode.

Another consideration is the use of dark mode with the site's brand identity. A brand identity is a set of visual elements that represent a brand, such as the logo, colors, and typography. When implementing dark mode, you should consider how the dark mode feature is consistent with your brand's colors and style. It is fine to have the brand icon and buttons at full saturation, while the surrounding elements are desaturated.

In general, when it comes to design, you always want to be mindful of the user experience and contrast levels. Dark mode is no exception, and by following these best practices, you can create a dark mode feature that is effective and user-friendly.

## 2.4. What are best practices for designing breadcrumbs?

When it comes to web design, there are many types of navigational aids you can use. Examples include top navigation bars, sidebars, and footers. But if your site is on the more complex side with deeper levels of navigation, you might want to consider using breadcrumbs.

Breadcrumbs are a navigation aid that shows the user where they are in the site's hierarchy. Here is an example of what breadcrumbs look like for a mock-up electronics website:

```md
Home/Electronics/Phones/Smartphone XYZ
```

In most websites, breadcrumbs are displayed at the top of the page, showing the user the path they took to get to the current page. Starting from the `Homepage`, the user navigated to the `Electronics` category, then to the `Phones` category, and finally to the `Smartphone XYZ` product. You have probably interacted with breadcrumbs on a website as you were searching for a product or specific piece of information.

The use of breadcrumbs is helpful because it can help users understand where they are in the site's hierarchy and how to navigate back to the previous pages. This is especially useful when a user has come from a search result or an external link and needs to understand the context of the page they are on.

When it comes to designing breadcrumbs, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. The first is to decide on what the separator will be. The separator is the character that separates the different levels of the hierarchy. Common separators include the greater than sign (`>`), right angle quotation marks (`»`) ,and the forward slash (`/`).

The second consideration is the placement of the breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs are typically placed at the top of the page, either above or below the main navigation bar. Users shouldn't have to struggle to find the breadcrumbs, so make sure they are visible and easy to locate.

Another consideration is the size of the breadcrumbs. You want to make sure the breadcrumbs are large enough to be easily read, but not so large that they take up too much space on the page. Remember, the breadcrumbs aren't meant to serve as a primary navigation tool, but rather as a secondary navigational aid. In websites where there is a lot of information on a page, users can easily see where they are in the hierarchy and navigate back to previous pages using breadcrumbs.

So when should you use breadcrumbs on your site? If your site is simple and has a shallow hierarchy, breadcrumbs might not be necessary. A shallow hierarchy means that the site has only a few levels of navigation, so breadcrumbs might not add much value. Typically, you will see breadcrumbs on e-commerce sites, news sites, and other sites with a deep hierarchy like technical documentation sites.

## 2.5. What are best practices for designing cards?

Card components are a very common occurrence in e-commerce, social media, and news sites. They are used to help display information in a structured way. When you are designing your cards, it is important to understand best practices so your users can easily understand the information you are trying to convey.

The first consideration for card design should be simplicity. You don't want your cards to be visually cluttered or display too much information. For example, if a card design is visually cluttered, there will be too much information for the user to process all at once. Having less information and good spacing between items on the card makes it easier for the user to process the information, and allows for multiple cards on the page.

Another thing to consider is where the user can click on the card. Some card designs will have a single button, making it obvious where the user can click. Other card designs will have the entire card clickable. When the user hovers over any part of the card, the card will change color or have a shadow effect to indicate that the card is clickable. Whatever design you choose, it needs to be consistent throughout your site and easy for the user to understand.

Another consideration is the use of media on your cards. Choosing high-quality media can significantly enhance the user experience. If you are using images or videos for say a product card, the higher the quality the more the user will be interested in that product. But if you use poor media quality, then the user might not trust the quality of your products and services.

One of the last things to consider is the use of color hierarchy. You want to make sure that the most important information on the card is the most prominent. You can use bright colors for important elements like a call-to-action button, and light colors for less important items on a card.

As you continue to work on web applications, keep in mind the different best practices for card design. This will help you create better user experiences for your users.

## 2.6. What are best practices for designing infinite scrolls?

Infinite scrolling is a design pattern that loads more content as the user scrolls down the page. Oftentimes, this is used on social media sites like Twitter. For example, if you are logged in and want to see more tweets, you can scroll down and more tweets will load. This is an example of infinite scrolling.

Infinite scrolling is also used as a substitute for pagination. Pagination is a design pattern that breaks up content into pages. This is often used when there is a lot of content to display. An example of pagination is when you search for something on Google and you see the search results on multiple pages. With pagination, you have to click on a button to go to the next page. With infinite scrolling, you just keep scrolling down and more content will load.

As you incorporate infinite scrolling into your design, there are a few best practices to keep in mind. The first consideration is to provide a "Load More" button that loads the next set of results when the user clicks on it. This is a good way to give the user control over when they want to see more content.

Another consideration would be to add a "Back" button. This gives users the ability to go back to the previous page without having to scroll all the way back up. This creates a better user experience and gives them more control over their browsing experience.

Sometimes you will see designs with a "Back to the top" button which leads users back to the top of the page of results. Another consideration is to provide a loading indicator. Users should have a clear indication that more content is being loaded; otherwise, they might think that the page is broken.

One of the last considerations would be to keep the footer accessible to the user. If the footer contains important information, then it should be accessible to the user at all times.

In conclusion, infinite scrolling is a great way to display content on your website. However, you should keep in mind the best practices when designing your infinite scroll so that you can provide the best user experience possible.

## 2.7. What are best practices for designing modal dialogs?

What is a **modal**? It's the type of pop-up that a website might show you on top of their content.

The content behind a modal is usually dimmed. This helps the user visually focus on the area you want them to interact with – in this case, the modal.

It's always a good idea to allow the user to click outside of the modal to close it.

You'll often see very prominent buttons on modals. These are called **CTAs, or call-to-action**. You want these to be easily identifiable since the purpose of interrupting the user's flow with a modal is to prompt them to take a specific action.

Modals should also have a close button. While you may really want the user to click on your CTAs, it's important to give them an option to back out of the modal and resume whatever they were previously doing.

There are, of course, accessibility concerns with modals, such as correctly managing focus on elements. However, if you use these general practices as your starting point, you'll have a solid foundation to build on.

## 2.8. What are best practices for designing progress indication on forms, registration and setup?

Progress indication is a way to show users how far they are in a process. It can be used in forms, registration, and setup processes. The goal is to help users understand where they are in the process and how much more they need to do.

For example, you can use a progress indication bar to show users what is left to do when filling forms. You don't want to create a situation where the user needs to fill out a lengthy form and they don't know how many more steps they need to complete. Transparency is key so the user knows whether they have enough time to sit down and complete the form or if they need to come back later.

When designing a progress indication section, there are a few best practices to keep in mind. The first consideration is to keep it simple. You don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information where they get frustrated and leave the site.

The second consideration is to make it possible to go back to previous steps. This is important because users may want to go back and check their previous answers or make changes.

Another consideration is to make the progress indication section easy to find. If the user can't find it, they won't know how far they are in the process.

The last consideration is to have clear section titles, percentages, or steps. If you just have a progress bar with no context, the user won't know what it means.

These are just a few best practices to keep in mind when designing progress indication on forms, registration, and setup processes. Study a few examples on big websites and see how they implement progress indication. Then test your design with real users to see how well it works.

## 2.9. What are best practices for designing shopping carts?

There are thousands of e-commerce websites on the internet, and the shopping cart is a crucial part of the e-commerce experience. A good design can make the shopping cart experience more enjoyable and increase sales. A poor design can lead to abandoned carts and lost sales.

In this lecture, we will discuss some best practices for designing shopping carts. The first design consideration is making sure the shopping cart is visible to users at all times. Most shopping cart designs will have the cart displayed in the upper right hand corner of the page. Users should see the number of items in their cart displayed next to the cart icon, and be able to click on the cart to see more details about the items they are purchasing.

Another consideration is providing a clear way for users to update the quantity of items in their cart. This can be done by providing a quantity input field next to each item in the cart. Users can easily update the quantity of an item by changing the number in the input field.

You should also provide a "Remove" button next to each item in the cart. This allows users to easily remove items from their cart. You don't want to make it difficult for users to remove items from their cart, as this can lead to frustration and abandoned carts.

Another consideration is the shopping cart icon itself. The icon should be something easily recognizable for all users. A common icon is a shopping cart with a handle and wheels. Other icons might be a shopping bag or a basket. But you don't want to choose an icon that is too abstract or difficult to understand.

When the user wants to review the total in their cart, they should be able to easily find the total cost of all items in the cart. This should be displayed prominently on the page, so users don't have to search for it.

Finally, you should provide a clear call-to-action button for users to proceed to checkout. This button should be prominently displayed on the page, so users don't have to search for it.

You don't want to have too many buttons on the page, as this can lead to confusion. The call-to-action button should be the most prominent button on the page, so users know exactly what to do next. You should use the brand's primary color for the button, so it stands out from the rest of the page.

These are just a few best practices for designing shopping carts. By following these guidelines, you can create a shopping cart that is easy to use and will help increase sales for your e-commerce website.

## 2.10. What is progressive disclosure?

A **progressive disclosure** is a design pattern used to only show users relevant content based on their current activity and hide the rest. This is done to reduce cognitive load and make the user experience more intuitive.

For example, when you use Google's search page, most of your searches will be simple. So having a simple user interface with very few options makes sense. But for the few times you will need a more advanced search, Google provides an advanced search option that will reveal more options.

You can find Google's advanced search option from the settings menu on the Google homepage. Or you can go to `google.com/advanced_search`.

Another example of progressive disclosure would be the "More details" button on products in an e-commerce website. When you visit a site like Amazon, you will see a list of product images in different categories. This allows users to shop with ease and not get overwhelmed by too much information.

If the user is interested in a particular product, they can click on the product image to reveal more details about the product. Displaying all of the information right away may be overwhelming for the user. So, by using progressive disclosure, the user can choose to see more information when they are ready.

So, what are some best practices for designing with the progressive disclosure technique? The first consideration is to keep all important information visible at all times. Users should not have to struggle to find key information because it is hidden by extra advanced features.

Another consideration is to provide a single access point for users to access additional features or information. This could be a button or link that is always visible on the page. Consider again Amazon's site: the additional product information is only made available when the user click on the product they are interested in. There aren't multiple buttons or links to click on to see the additional information. Adding multiple access points can be confusing for users and can lead to a poor user experience.

As you design your applications, think about the overall user experience and how you can use progressive disclosure to make it easier for users to find the information they need. When done correctly it can make a big difference to the overall user experience.

## 2.11. What is deferred/lazy registration in UI design?

**Lazy registration** is a UI design pattern that allows users to browse and interact with your application without having to register. A good example of this would be an e-commerce site. Users should be able to browse through the products and add a few items to their cart. Then, if they are interested in purchasing, they will need to register.

The reason is that users need to see the value your site offers before they are willing to provide their information and register. When designing your applications, users should be able to see the value and feel like the application is safe to provide their information. Otherwise, they will not be willing to register and you will lose potential customers.

You will need to make sure to communicate that the user's sensitive data will be protected and secure. In later modules, we will discuss how to secure your application and protect your user's data.

Another good example of lazy registration would be YouTube. YouTube is a video sharing platform with millions of videos on everything from tech, pop culture, and gaming. If you visit YouTube, users can watch as many videos as they like without needing to sign in or register. However, if they want to like, comment, or subscribe to a channel, they will need to register.

If the user likes the content they are watching or wants to participate in the conversations, then they will be more willing to register. Lazy registration is a useful design pattern that allows users to see the value of your application before they are willing to provide their information.

The next time you are designing an application, consider using lazy registration to increase user engagement and retention.
